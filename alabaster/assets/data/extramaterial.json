More precisely, a SGRUB fan adventure. That's right, with trolls.\nThere are infinitely many SBURBdventures in the fandom, infinitely many stories with Alternian trolls too, and finally, MULTIPLE infinities of SGRUBdventures featuring trolls. But I started this one anyway, for many reasons, for fun, for training, because I had many ideas, because I did an enormous amount of preparation, and because I was just sure the ride would be worth it.\n\n- [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] contains a cast of six Players. These main characters are parodies from existing archetypes/fandoms and fantrolls.\n\n- It is not a canon story (obviously), but it tries to respect canon, and to extend it in the most logical and ridiculous ways.\n\n- As an affectionate [i]détournement[/i] of the very concept of spinoff, the characters are never going to directly interact with the canon ones.\n\n- It features an \"Hussiesprite\" style imitating [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u]'s most known graphical chart. It also contains a personal take at Hero Mode (which works like a mix of Hero and Scribble Mode with another way to work the proportions and brush marks) and many other Modes, mainly a different Mode for each main character.\n\n- Even if a lot of friends are nice enough to help me (see the credits for more details), I am doing the main narration and all of the pictures alone.\n\n- The panels are mainly done with good old MS Paint, and MS Paint alone, with the use of the transparent selection tool which is featured in it since at least Windows 3.1. I never use any layers. There must be something like 10% of panels which have been partially made with other programs, because I needed some animated gifs and some filters, and that's about it. It is truly a MS Paint Adventure.\n\n- Except in special cases (crossing the canon story, or Copycat's plagiarist antics), I don't recycle Hussie's drawings.\n\n- [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] isn't for everyone. Really, if you have a sensitive heart, you would probably be better to not read it. [/left]</FONT>",

These trolls are six sweeps old, way younger than Vamuin or any of his friends, and they usually don't talk a lot to older people, mainly because trolls can be predators in multiple ways. The majority of Alternian population never heard of these twelve individuals, with the noticeable exceptions of Team Scourge, two of the most bloodthirsty FLARP players of this time, and the Heir Apparent, Feferi Peixes.\nThree characters in our story know of these kids: Sectra falls in love with Twelvies regularly, Copycate imitates them and finally, Ophiuchus is a complete stalker and a very disturbed person pretending to be their \"Secret Leader\" without even [i]meeting[/i] them.\nOphiuchus the Great is the one who invented the \"Main Twelve\" appellation, he equally calls them \"The Holy Ones\", the \"Neverending\", the \"Eternal Lightness\" and \"The Pillars of Equilibrium\", thinking they are merged reincarnations of the Blind Prophets and most legendary Troll Empress, and that they are destined to save the world by finding their totem selves and transfigurating the Deathstream under his command.[/left]</FONT>\n\n",

I just showed it to the betareading team and they were all \"Hey, not bad, it looks kinda creepy\". That was a bad reaction for me. All the Minions and Denizens had to be completely horrible.\nSo I re-did the concept of Patriarcha's Minions from scratch. \n\n\n\n\n\n[u]Nurse Drone[/u]\n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/nursedrone.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\n[u]Tentacleking[/u]\n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/tentaclekingdesign.png[/img]\n\nSome details are different [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/sprites/tentacle_king.png]from the final design[/url].[/left]</FONT>\n",

You cannot avoid to be crushed two times by the tooth-and-dental-drill hammer. But these deaths are not taken into account in the final ranking.\n\n\n[u]Room 6 &acirc;�� Furryback[/u]\nYou must be standing on the floor in order to jump on the tail. The creature's back is a little platform dead end, and you will encounter a lot of trenches of this kind on your way.\n\n\n[u]Room 7 &acirc;�� Spikes Belly A[/u]\nA simple platform progress. Little ruse: when you are on an upper cube, you can directly fall on a lower one by simple walking. Don't try the lowest cube partially covered with a beartrap, it is... a trap.\n\n\n[u]Room 8 &acirc;�� Free hugs[/u]\nBe quick enough.\n\n\n[u]Room 9 &acirc;�� Spikes Belly B[/u]\nThe left and right controls are reversed in this room.\n\n\n[u]Room 10 &acirc;�� Spikes Belly C[/u]\nNo change except for the screen shaking.\n\n\n[u]Room 11 &acirc;�� Spikes Belly D[/u]\nDespite the screen reversing, the jumping key is still X or Up.\n\n\n[u]Room 12 &acirc;�� Magical love[/u]\nWalk slowly.\n\n\n[u]Room 13 &acirc;�� Spikes Belly E[/u]\nThe controls stay the same. Keep concentrating on jumps and if you really have problems, wait for the screen to be in the normal orientation.\n\n\n[u]Room 14 &acirc;�� The prisoner[/u]\nMemorize the precise course you are about to use to progress in this room. It will be important.\nWhen you are before the cage, don't try to jump on it, jump and press the Left button. Ginneo needs to reach a little protuberance in the flesh column above him. From there, he can find his way to the exit.\n\n\n[u]Room 15 &acirc;�� Reversed broken turntable[/u]\nJump in the hole.\n\n\n[u]Room 16 &acirc;�� Corrupted broken turntable[/u]\nAvoid the little filling hole and jump on the boxes.\n\n\n[u]Room 17 &acirc;�� Friends' room[/u]\nAt some point in the room, the left and right controls will be reversed. As soon as it happens, start pressing Left instead of Right, in order to run to the right and to exit the place.\n\n\n[u]Room 18 &acirc;�� Prisoner on the loose[/u]\nThe course is identical to those of the prisoner's room. It is a tricky labyrinth, be especially careful about the little bump you need to reach before the cage, and about the dead end in the upper right end.\n\n\n[u]Room 19 &acirc;�� Run run little grub[/u]\nHold the Right key even before touching the ground.\n\n\n[u]Room 20 &acirc;�� Mirror room[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 21 - Crucifixion[/u]\nIf you didn't fall directly on the cross, jump to the left, then on the cross, then on the upper half of the floor, and avoid falling in the hole filled with bodies.\n\n\n[u]Room 22 &acirc;�� The past is dead[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 23 &acirc;�� Tentacles[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 24 &acirc;�� Snails[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 25 &acirc;�� In the tree[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 26 &acirc;�� Three Flying Friends[/u]\nThe controls are reversed three times in this room.\n\n\n[u]Room 27 &acirc;�� Holes[/u]\nJump in the hole.\n\n\n[u]Room 28 &acirc;�� F&Aring;�tus[/u]\nJump in the hole.\n\n\n[u]Room 29 &acirc;�� Alternian Graffiti[/u]\nJump in the hole at the right time, then run to the exit, to the right.\n\n\n[u]Room 30 &acirc;�� Screaming tree[/u]\nGet on the tree.\n\n\n[u]Room 31 &acirc;�� Fingers[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 32 &acirc;�� Cry[/u]\nAdvance. From this point, you can cry.\n\n\n[u]Room 33 &acirc;�� Headrobbed[/u]\nAdvance. You can still cry.\n\n\n[u]Room 34 &acirc;�� The perch[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 35 &acirc;�� Punishment A[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 36 &acirc;�� Punishment B[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 37 &acirc;�� Punishment C[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 38 &acirc;�� Punishment D[/u]\nAdvance.\n\n\n[u]Room 39 &acirc;�� Execution[/u]\nStay at the exact center of the room to receive the sentence.\n\n\n[u]Room 40 &acirc;�� Back to the White Hive[/u]\nUse the stairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[u]BOSS &acirc;�� Flesh & Bones[/u]\n\nThe Bones have two attacks: a vertical one and a horizontal one. They can be identified by looking at the height of the hands before they hit.\nAvoid the vertical attacks by moving left and right and placing yourself between the hands.\nAvoid the horizontal attacks by jumping.\n\nThe Flesh stays in the background. It grows when you cries. If you are hit, it reduces. You must make the thing swell up until it explodes.\nAvoid every attack you can while holding C as frequently as you can in order to defeat it.\nIf you experience issues with horizontal attacks by the end of fight, try crying only between vertical ones. \n\nThe boss can be very long to be defeated if you keep being hit. But you can beat it in less than two minutes by being quick and precise. Just take your time, relax and concentrate.[/left]</FONT>",

The complete, chattier version can be given on demand, but be aware it doesn't contain any more information on Alabaster itself, only a bunch of trivia and useless stuff.[/i][/left]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What is the sickest, most terrifyingly disturbing fate you could possibly think of if you really tried?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">To answer precisely: Ginneo's fate, probably. Vamuin's and Batori's will be nice, too. As a matter of fact, all the SGRUBrip Players will meet satisfyingly horrible destinies, but Ginneo's... You'll see.\n\nMy first major concern about disturbing elements is how deep I can manage to go while keeping the story interesting. If I put too much of it in one point, it could just stop being creepy, you see? Just look at some precise Tim Burton's movies, like [u][i]Beetlejuice[/i][/u] and [u][i]Batman Returns[/i][/u]: these ones were so weird, so twisted, we just don't feel the weirdness anymore.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]WHY. JUST... GIN. WHY.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Thank you! Hehehe. It was hard to do more disturbing than [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] canon.\n\nAt the early stages of preparation, Ginneo was only known as \"the cute stupid one\", kind of the lovechild of Tavros and Nepeta. Then I thought \"Hey, we miss a really disturbing character besides the [Censored] Player, why don't I add some Equius to the mix?\".\nBut it didn't add up until my British friend BobIsOnlyBob told me in a entirely unrelated conversation \"[i]You know, these furry fellows can be pretty disturbing... Have you ever talked to [i]Second Life[/i]'s babyfur roleplayers? They never get out of character. Never. Ever. You can talk to them all day and they are still babies. Furry babies[/i]\".\n\nIt was perfect for the tone I had in mind. Some kind of unclear (unclean?) zone which can really get to people, because they don't know where to stand exactly (beside the obvious \"[i]DO NOT WANT[/i]\"). \n\nBob and Flabber Ghast provided me with examples and little stories, since they had spoken to some real-world babyfurs. I adapted it into the Alternian culture, and mainly, the Ginneo you all know and love was born then.\nI must really thank Flabber, who wrote all of Ginneo's lines during AIM-logs, and also found some horrible details like Ginneo's unicorn horn and the explanation about his brainwashing. Flabber is Ginneo's parent as well as I am.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Why's Vamuin's symbol a cornucopia?[/u][/left] \n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Under the Gary Stu parody and the asshole/stupid/mean-minded personality, and partially because of it, Vamuin is a solar figure (the \"golden crown\" of hair). Deep down, he is less linked to the gods naming him and more to abundance, seasons and all the correlative codes. And since he's mainly controlled by his lower urges, he also retains a lot of Dionysus-like darkness (especially, his parties are bacchanalia). Finally, he is a hero, in the demigod sense.\nThe cornucopia, or harvest horn, is linked to both first and second parts of these buried thematics, the Apollo and Dionysus legacies. It means food and abundance. It means gold and celebration. It means a lot of things, and it is also very appropriate for any kind of Gary Stu/Mary Sue character. These figures are usually blessed with neverending fortune and qualities. \n\nI was admirative at what the [u][i]Skins[/i][/u] series (UK version) did with apparently modern/superficial/direct/straight-minded/mundane/realistic characters, burying tons of heavy material deeply under them. It is totally invisible, but it has resonance. When you watch the show, you can feel it.\n\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed040.png[/img]\n\nThis is [Insert random mythological hero here] for you! And it is also a reference to Perseus riding Pegasus in [i][u]Clash of the Titans[/u][/i] (1981 version, please, or I'll get [i]more[/i] angry). Truly, with modern adaptations, this poor Pegasus is the steed of many heroes who didn't even meet him in the original mythology. Was Pegasus the motorbike of ancient badasses?</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I am delighted to hear this is going to get even darker. I have a really hard time finding horror strong enough to work for me, this is one of a very few.[/u][/left] \n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Thank you!\n\nHere are some titles that could work for you. They creeped me out. Horror can be very personal stuff, though, so maybe it won't have the same effect on you.\n\n\nBooks:\nThe Shadow over Innsmouth (Lovecraft)\nThe puppet masters (Heinlein)\nRing (Suzuki)\nParasite Eve (Sena)\n\nMovies:\nEyes without a face (Franju)\nThe Thing (Carpenter)\nMartyrs (Laugier)\nRing (Nakata)\n\nVideo games:\nSilent Hill 1 (Konami)\nSilent Hill 4: The Room (Konami)\nDemento/Haunting Ground (Capcom)\nDrakengard (Squaresoft)\n\nAnimes:\nMonster (Madhouse)\nNeon Genesis Evangelion (Gainax)\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica (Shaft)\nCare Bears Movie II: A New Generation (Schott)</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Why do I keep going back to this adventure even though I'm squeamish and I can't stand horror? Is it because I hope that everything will be better, even if Ginneo is creepy and tragic and his lusus wants to skin him alive? Where does this all come from?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Narrative mechanisms can only be described as being extremely tricky. One can be immersed and taken away by the flow of the story even before realising it. And the serial format is one of the most addicting ones. \n\nBe reassured. Despite the overwelming dark aspect, you will certainly find some positive elements by the end of the story.\n\nThere is a sentence in France, in many fairytales. \"[i]Et ils vécurent heureux et eurent beaucoup d'enfants[/i]\". It's the French equivalent of \"[i]And they lived happily ever after[/i]\", with additional joyful implications.\n\nThere is some truth within it. Sometimes, you just need to believe in magic.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]  \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]So is the royalty going to be the actual villains for once? And is everyone going to prototype ridiculous things into their kernelsprite?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Indeed, the royalty will play a major part in the story as antagonists. We will also see some interesting free spirits (but not the Jack Noir kind).\nIn spite of this, the real stars will be the Denizens. They were amongst my biggest motivations to start [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]. To date, 29th April 2011, I don't know what Hussie wants to do with Denizens exactly. Nonetheless, great concepts invaded my head about the Lands' bosses and I thought this interpretation could be interesting. So the Denizens were designed before the beginning of the Adventure, along with Minions, Consorts and other things.\n\nOn the other hand, far away from this kind of planning, the prototypings are meant to be \"free will moments\" for the readers. I didn't design any kind of prototyping before the beginning. They are part of the surprise even for me.\nIn addition, if you think I have selected the most ridiculous suggestions for Vamuin's sprite, you are mistaken. I won't do random/silly sprites, for the same reason I don't do stairs jokes or SB&HJ jokes: Hussie is already doing it. You're not reading a fanwork in order to read a copy of the main story. You're looking for variations.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Are you accepting characters created by other people? Because I have a few who at the least I think you can draw some elements off of.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I'm not accepting art created by other people inside the adventure. All the pics are Cauchemar-made, and it includes Homesprites. Of course, it's also recycling Hussie's sprites and universe... But I like to be the only one to draw and to write the narration.\n\nSo don't send me your sprites! I don't have any use for them.\n\nOn another hand, some of the main characters are partially created by other people!\nGinneo just would not be the same without Flabber the Ghast, but Flabber is only helping with him. There are more interesting cases: [Censored] and Sectra, who, strangely enough, will also be the last characters to appear.\nSectra is based upon an original idea and a name from Kessie.\n[Censored]'s original idea and design are from sadisticNothings.\nFor these two characters I am entrusted with, I took entire creative freedom (it was in the soul contract).\n\nIf you want to offer me your characters or your concepts, go for it. Maybe I'll use them (even if there are not a lot of remaining places in the story for them already), maybe I'll not. If I use them, I'll surely credit you. But be aware: every character will come back in packages. Many packages.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Crazy awesome Denizen's sound amazing. Are there any designs you'd consider sharing? Also, are you actually in France?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Sharing designs? Oh, definitively!\n\nRenart's lusus:\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/murder.png[/img]\n\nSome Consort:\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/mammoth.png[/img]\n\nA Minion:\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/dice.png[/img]\n\nI'm sorry, but you're not seeing more, surprise is half the pleasure.\n\nAnd here is all you need to know about me: I'm a young French person and I'm a little fairy in disguise. Maybe I'll tell you more when [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] is finished!</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]  \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Why does everyone know who the \"Main Twelve\" are? I assumed they were just regular trolls.[/u][/left] \n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Yes, everything in the canon points to Karkat's group being ordinary troll kids.\n\nVamuin (and later other characters) neither know the \"Main Twelve\" nor care about them. Only three characters know them, and have an unhealthy obsession towards them: Ophiuchus the Great, Sectra and Copycat.\n\nBesides the infamous Team Scourge and of course Feferi, the Main Twelve are just unknown kids. At least as far as we are talking about [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]'s interpretation of Alternia.\n\nThese days, the webmasters of the MSPFA Mirror are discussing the possibility of adding Standalone pages (like the Exile ones) to their site. If they do so, you will surely be able to find this data, and other interesting things, in the [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] secrets.\n\n[i]It finally happened, taking the shape of the Extra Material pages you are reading right now.[/i]</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]  \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]As much as Goldie's message scares me, it also has me wondering why the Troll universe apparently has an equivalent of Portal, right down to the song.[/u][/left] \n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Hussie's Alternia already contains many features reminiscent from Earth. And a lot of them are very precise ones, like public characters or trademark beverages.\n\nThere is a very good narrative reason for this: like male and female genders, it helps us to relate to the trolls.\nBut there is also possible in-universe explanations. The one [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] relates to is this one: since trolls have created the human universe, we are bearing echoes of their culture. It is very close of one of the most fascinating Hussie's concepts: his vision of collective subconscious carrying antediluvian realities and implanting them into human society.\n\nSo trolls don't have a version of [i][u]Portal[/u][/i]. We have a version of [i][u]Troll Portal[/u][/i].\n\n(You are now fully aware that Glados is a valid troll first name.)</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]So, what's the story behind Gin's horns? His original ones, I mean. And any of the others you'd like to share?[/u][/left] \n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The left horn is a graphical link to the canon Hivebent arc. All troll horns aren't so extraordinary and unique. Sometimes, you find two trolls with the exact same horn. So I took this \"nail\" shape Vriska and Kanaya have in common, I only made a longer upper spike.\nThe right horn is very subtle. This looks like some kind of fork, but actually, it is one of the incarnations of the fourth number. It is a digital 4.\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/digitalfour.png[/img]\nThis \"four\" is referring to the four limbs of an adult troll, in opposition to the six-limbed grub form which is the fantasy state of Ginneo's current personality.\n\nVamuin's horns aren't linked to any of his thematics: I was only searching for a stylish horn scheme, and I liked the horns-mandible thing a friend made for a helmet design. I tried the same kind of thing, not the exact same shape, but I wanted an elegant horns-mandibles disposition.\n\nAbout other horn shapes. Sectra has \"antenna\" horns, but really, it doesn't need to be indicated... Hmm... Oh yeah! Some secondary characters have really symbolic horns.\nThat's because they need to be well-characterized (too little screen time) while most of them cannot have too special clothes. The majority of troll teenagers are clearly dressed the same way than Karkat and his friends, simple gray and black clothes... Trolls don't like fashion, remember?\nSo here is some data about secondary characters' horns:\n\n- [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/via.png]Via[/url] (Vamuin's moirail) has cow horns because she is symbolically cow-related,\n- [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/hem.png]Hem[/url] (Vamuin's kismesis) has Karkat-like tiny nubby horns because \"Karkat\" is the emblematic spades romance character,\n- [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/wey.png]Wey[/url] (Vamuin's auspistice) has wing-shaped horns because his last name is Psonen, an ancient eagle being in Abenaki mythology (also explains his symbol),\n- [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/tozy.png]Tozy[/url] (Vamuin's matesprit) has snake-shaped horns and symbol for the exact same reason and origins in mythology than Wey, except this time, it's his first name and an ancient snake-human being,\n- [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/ophiuchus.png]Ophiuchus the Great[/url]'s horns are the beginning and the end, the first and the last, the alpha and the omega, and also the biggest pileup of pretty nonsensical shapes ever.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How long to plan on this adventure running? How many trolls will we play as? How long will the actual session last? Can you share with us what you think the canon Denizens look like?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">You will play as six trolls, the six Players of the SGRUBrip session. For now, the Entry order is:\n\n1 - Vamuin\n2 - Ginneo\n3 - Batori\n4 - ???\n5 - ???\n6 - Sectra\n\nThere will be six Chapters, one for each Player. Each chapter will present a new Mode and a new minigame, both linked to the player. Vamuin's were Cine Mode and Skytroll, Ginneo's are Extracute Mode and Silent Hive...\n\nThe Adventure will last approximately 600 pages. Yep, we are already reaching 300. The final chapter will be extremely short, for obvious reasons.\n\nSince the SGRUBrip session will really begin in the following days, it will be approximately 300 pages long.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAnd that was the really informative part of this answer. Because my opinion about Hussie's work is just an opinion. Simple theory:\n\n- The Denizens won't look like their minions. If they were, the author wouldn't refuse to show even a finger of them.\n- The Denizens will be important to the story. They are just coming too late (narratively speaking) to be secondary or constitute mere antics.\n- The Denizens will be truly gigantic. Just look at Hephaestus' hammer or think about what kind of giant needle can scratch the surface of the Godzilla-sized disk.\n- The Denizens will be sentient and possibly highly intelligent. Apparently, minions are smart enough to steal important items from heroes (at least that's what Alternate Future Dave tells us). There is no reason for their masters to be stupider.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]\"For obvious reasons\"?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Yes, for obvious reasons. The last chapter will be extremely short for obvious reasons: we are talking about a SBURB session so screwed in every sense the Kids' one will look easy to win by comparison.\n\nAbandon hope, all ye who enter here.[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Considering Ginneo'z arc was quite long and enjoyable albeit not so informative, wouldn't be 300 pages for four more characters and SBURB's antics to take place quite short ? Should we expect a change of pace ?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Yes, clearly.\n\nChapter 1 and 2 were necessary to establish important elements and thematics. But in their structure, they were mostly slow and very simple: we were following the first two Players in their daily environment. \nFrom now, we will switch between characters a lot more frequently. The chapter of a character cannot be only \"their\" chapter any longer: it will be a pileup of events advancing simultaneously, and quite quickly.\nIt doesn't mean I will forget about character development. In reality, from now, it becomes easy. The most delicate narrative parts are already integrated.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n</FONT>",

Then questions came back with the [S] Vamuin: Land and didn't stop since.\n\nThe first question is actually a joke from some French reader, a message copy/pasted of Hussie's second late Formspring, and slightly modified in order to relate to my life. I started the answer in the same tone, by copy/pasting and subtly modifying Hussie's answer.[/i][/left]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u] ARE YOU TRAPPED IN EPITANIME?? ? ? ? ?? ? PLEASE COME HOME[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I am not trapped in Epita. I got back on Monday night. The grumpy friends from a amateur movie team looked at me suspiciously and considered the threat I posed to good taste for a little while, and then I guess finally decided to do me this rad solid by letting me back into my own neighbourhood.\n\nThe EPITANIME convention was fun and I met lots of cool people. And... nope, we're not doing this. Not going to copypaste anymore. That would be silly. I mean, sillier than usual.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I have read quite a lot of depressing stories like Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four for example. And would it be a fair assessment to assume that the heroes of this story will have a worse ending than the heroes of those kind of stories?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Those are some of the most depressive endings imaginable, along with the conclusion of the magnificent movie [u][i]Brazil[/i][/u]. But I don't think they are comparable to [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]'s. I'm not saying it in a \"It will be worse\" tone, but rather literally. This is not comparable.\nDystopian novels have a very special kind of doom in store for their heroes. It's usually all about love. It is disturbing both because it incarnates the end of freedom and sentient life as we know it (with multiple possibilities of rebellion or lateral thinking) and because one will always automatically link these future/alternate societies to what they know about the current state of the world.\n\nI am looking for another feeling here. Less about the most depressing endings you can get and more about the most uncomfortable. If you want an approximate guess at the way things will turn out to the end, just watch this part of one [u][i]Drakengard[/i][/u] ending: \n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx-q8mPJVGU]Fear Not the Watchers[/url]\n</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n</FONT>",

I am in no hurry and this shouldn't be rushed. It's way too good for that. But you're the boss. :([/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Originally, I was planning to make this a very short adventure with only normal, \"frozen\" panels (not a single animated gif), and a kinda rigid structure of 100 panels for each chapter (the adventure containing 6 chapters, one for each character).\nIt seemed reasonable to me, since I didn't intend to get sidetracked by photocopying the usual antics (naming, shit on the desk, presents, strife with the guardians, SB&HJ), because it was already done by Hussie. The \"Speedplay\" part was already there in the first days of the projects, before I decided of the cast, before I even designed the Denizens.\nIt fitted nicely in my schedule. I estimated by the rhythm of the first updates I could easily finish the thing for July. Afterwards, I would have the entire summer to prepare a new Paint project, and to work on the professional ones, too.\n\nWith my usual lack of lucidity, I jumped from the bed some day \"Yeah, let's do a Flash game for each chapter and a Flash movie for each Land!\". For a long time, I updated while simultaneously working on these Flash bonus. I wanted each Flash to be ready at the exact right time in the story, while updating continuously. It was easy with the first game. It began to turn to nightmare with the second one. Chapter 2 may have seemed short to readers, but for me, it is way too long, just like the wandering around with various characters at the start of Chapter 3. I have overblown my various deadlines since a long time. I don't complain about it, since part of the interest for me was to better understand my rhythm and limitations. But it was a problem, because it was butchering my rhythm and stealing the time I could use for professional projects.\nOf course, there was also the problem of Arkh's implication. I am not a Flash programmer, all the code was made by Arkh. I was starting to do part of the technical work myself, but I still needed him and I wanted neither to have to rely on him nor turning his life into a living hell. Not to mention another real-life friend, Shadow Phoenix, who did the upload for the heaviest files. I didn't feel like parasitizing his website forever.\nSo it was just complications and complications and fillers starting to surreptitiously appear in a work originally conceived as a matter of speed and efficiency.\n\nWhile completing [S] Vamuin: Land, I made a decision.\n\nBefore myself, as the results of the various problems I previously exposed, I had a simple choice:\n- To continue [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] with all the Flash projects, sabotaging the serious projects.\n- To abandon [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i].\n- To continue [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] without all the Flash projects.\nThe last option was clearly the right one.\nPlus in this particular case, the choice was easier because, like I said, the Flash games and movies weren't planned in the original schedule, so I was merely returning to a former idea.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]So that whole [url=./Alabaster.html?p=413]spanking thing[/url] and the [url= ./Alabaster.html?p=410]other thing[/url] how does that even work?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Look at this Cine Mode picture:\n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/dredganicinemode.png[/img]\n\nOne can see clearly in this more detailed view that the junction point between the male and female torsoes is situated, in both, under the butt.

All the sloppy details plz[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Many explanations would be possible. Hussiesprite Mode could be PG-13 so genitals don't appear (and the Cine Mode Sprite could be too luminous), Sprites are able to create various items with their own substance (Nannasprite creates a spectral oven and many other things), etc.\n\nBut here is the \"Alabaster canon\" clarification: whales have retractable reproductive organs.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How...?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Are people this deep into Kernelsprite fornication?\n\nThey are very supple, okay? Like porn models and porn actors usually are. Also a whale's penis is different. It works both by blood pressure and muscles. It can be led (and laid, yep) with ease. It's like homing device junk.\n\nLet's notice all of this precise answer is just mere theory, because we have no idea what troll sexual organs look like in canon, or how they work. Let's remember same-sex couples can fill pails. Honestly, despite the \"bone bulge\" thing, I wouldn't be surprised if they had all strange little flower stamens down there, or tentacles, or a little mouth like in [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D8IRIYBSnk]this funny Pandora biology animation movie[/url]. For all we know, they could mate with kissing. And let's not even think about how Alternian WHALE reproduction could work. If the troll reproduction/Alternian whale reproduction keeps the same amount of weirdness than human reproduction/whale reproduction in our world... Let'sstopthetheory here okay.\n\n(Writing the story as if troll reproduction worked almost the same than ours for the same reason than Hussie: it's easier to relate to trolls this way.)</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Do you realize that some of the people who criticize auspitice do not realize that an auspitice acts for the kismesis pair? \"You're doing auspitice wrong\" is wrong just by virtue of people don't understand how it relates.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Indeed auspisticism only concerns the black quadrant directly, but that is not all there is to it.\nIt also indirectly concerns Diamonds and Hearts.\n\nIn [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i], we have seen Kanaya, who is Vriska's *moirail*, to mediate between Tavros and Vriska. Actually, it is the first canon example of Clubs we see. It is unclear if the moirail is supposed to usually turn into an auspistice, if it's unusual or downright \"meddling\" from Kanaya. In the absence of any precise canon information about it, I'll just suppose it doesn't matter, but I keep in mind a moirail can apparently auspisticize.\n\nAbout Hearts, Hussie gives us [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=004300]this kind of nice picture[/url], insists about how quickly a black relationship can turn to red or vice-versa, or about how the relationship can be asymetrical, and in both cases, talks about the auspistice. \"This sort of relationship volatility is why conciliatory relationships are an important part of troll romance.\"\n\nAlso, when you're saying \"an auspistice acts for the kismesis pair\", let's precise, because your phrasing is strange here: an auspistice doesn't act for the LEGITIMATE kismesis pair. It acts for some hostile and conflicted relationship who is supposed to NOT become concupiscent. \"The auspistice mediates between the two, playing the role of a peace keeper, preventing the feud from boiling over into a fully caliginous rivalry\".\n\nA troll in perfect emotional equilibrium has all quadrants filled. In the Clubs case, it means either the individual has a non-concupiscent conflicted relationship with another troll, tranquilized by an auspistice, or the individual IS an auspistice mediating in this kind of relationship.\n\nIn Vamuin's case, obviously, \"auspistice\" is both a too passive and too reflective role for him, while he is known to be quite a flirt. [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/wey.png]Wey[/url] is his auspistice, mediating between him and another character currently unknown.\n(Since Vamuin is not particularly loyal to his concupiscent quadrants, one can wonder if there is a real risk of concupiscence in the unknown \"ashen rivalry\" Wey is auspisticizing for, or if Vamuin randomly chose one troll he wasn't particularly interested with in order to have all of his quadrants filled, just because it looks so \"cool\" around other trolls.)</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I know Varmuin is kind of a Gary Stu parody but even so, don't you normally need a particular instrument to use time power (at least before you reach God Tier). That seems a bit too abrupt.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">There appears to exist a major mystic difference, never established in the story (and not in Hussie's Formspring either, to my knowledge), between Derse and Prospit Dreamers.\n[b]The Players aligned with the Dark Kingdom seem to rely on external artifacts[/b] to use their powers. Doc Scratch implied in a conversation with Rose they may only need these tools to help them focus.\n[b]The Players aligned with the Light Kingdom don't rely on external forces[/b], they seem to find their powers directly inside themselves, without any help.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a grid view of the Game Powers demonstrated so far:\n\n[b]PROSPIT DREAMERS[/b]\nJohn - Heir of Breath - Wind Power - Internal\nTerezi - Seer of Mind - Prediction Power - Internal\nVriska - Thief of Light - Luck-stealing Power - Internal\nTavros - Heir of Breath - Breath (revitalizing?)

Her luck powers are used internally. She found the dices on Alternia and they are not related to the game, they are a traditional Gamblignant weapon. When Vriska uses the luck+dices combo, it just means by combining the two, she possesses one of the most excessive game breakers ever.\n\n\n\nVamuin is a Prospit Dreamer, and therefore doesn't need any kind of instrument to use his Time powers.\nHe is indeed a Gary Stu parody, but he is also a canonically-possible character. Independently, each of his characteristics (all quadrants filled, globetrotter, great physical strength, \"fatality\" kind of psionic power, etc) could be find in any random troll. It is the ACCUMULATION of these extremes which makes him an extremely overpowered, grotesque character.\n\nVamuin is not impossible, he's [i][b]improbable[/b][/i]. And this kind of Mary Sue may be [i]worse [/i]than the really god-like ones. Vamuin is this annoying fan who keeps telling you how much his fan character is human, deep, sensitive and precisely conceived, while so powerful and marvellous. Vamuin is also this tabletop RPG roleplayer who comes with an overloaded Player Character sheet and then constantly brags about his neverending and methodically done biography and his gamebreaking skills (of course \"equilibrated\" by fake, meaningless background disabilities). Vamuin is your nightmare in every fictional setting, the obscene incarnation of all power fantasies haunting monomaniac charactermakers.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I can't help but notice one of the Vamuin clone called him Alpha Vamuin. I thought he was using stable time loops like Dave but if he's actually using doomed clones... just how many alternate timeline did he doom just to make his life easier?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Well, from the name of the Orgy, we can guess there are at least 1000 Alternate Vamuins. Unless some of them went back in time just for living it once again, but let me tell you they didn't. So, logically, there are at least 1000 doomed timelines.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Er, that means a thousand other timelines are doomed along with their vaumins!!![/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Exactly.\n\nYou don't really want to know what horrors happen in these \"2x doomed\" timelines.\n\nThe Alpha timeline stays doomed too, just not in the same way.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How could this horrific circumstance come to pass? For all their potential callousness, neither Skaia nor the Horrorterrors appear to be sadistic entities, and I don't see any way for Lord English to profit from this atrocity. Like was Skaia drunk?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Your opinion is identical to mine. I don't think Skaia or the Horrorterrors are sadistic entities. I think they don't judge. Even if a SBURB session offers the Players the possibility to get past their flaws, it doesn't judge. The original Homestuck is not a story about judgment, it's a story about growing up.\n\nThen, the bad news. I can't tell you the intradiegetic (in-story) \"Why\". It would be extremely spoileriffic. Still, your question will receive a precise answer by the end of the adventure.\n\nFor now, I can talk a little about other reasons, the extradiegetic (out-of-story) ones. Not the reasons for such a succession of horrors to happen in the story (although those exist), but the reasons which motivated me to include these horrors, and to include them this way.\n\nToday, we'll talk about only one of them. We'll talk about \"poetic justice\".\n\nThe inverted commas are extremely important here, because I don't believe poetic justice is truly justice. In my opinion, the only \"justice\" any society needs to care about is the simple workings needed to avoid chaos. Punishment, revenge and such things are more complicated matter, and I won't detail my thoughts about it, but to put it roughly, I don't think murderers deserve capital punishment, I don't think rapists deserve to be raped, I don't think robbers deserve to be robbed. Firstly legally, and secondly morally. If an embezzler gets embezzled, of course, I'll be satisfied and I could even laugh, but intellectually, I won't think it's \"just\".\nI don't even thing imprisonment is a good thing. At core, it's still confinement of unwilling human beings. It is a very cruel thing to do to a conscious, sensitive creature. Think about a man spending his entire life in jail. Sure, it is necessary if he is a serial killer, for example, but it isn't pretty.\n\nBut I like \"poetic justice\" aesthetically. In a narration, it exudes an ineluctable, implacable feeling. Even more when the concept is extended enough to become grotesquely cruel. In [url= http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~in6481/GOED-2.jpg]Hieronymus Bosch's paintings[/url], sinners are confronted with horrible, neverending, sadistic and very inventive punishments for \"crimes\" which seem rather innocent to unreligious and modern persons (sloth, gluttony...).\n\nSo I don't agree with this idea of \"poetic justic\" philosophically or politically; however, I like the atmosphere it can give, the deep, antediluvian cruelty of it.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]could you put a list of the tropes you used for each character, if you already have (i may have seen it before) can you link it please?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The archetypes, and also the caricatures of fandom figures (all of the main characters are both, I wanted all of the Players to be true to Hussie's approach while adding some kind of meta-commentary about the fandom):\n\n\n\n\n[b]VAMUIN IKENGA[/b]\nPopculture archetype: The Handsome Surfer.

He was, by all accounts, an amazingly efficient and obsessive stalker.\n\nAnd there are very, very few things he got right. He regularly gets it wrong about the hives, the quirks, the blood, the modus and specibus, the clothes (did you notice his Nepeta doll has a canine hoodie instead of a feline one?) and of course the personalities. All of these errors are aggravated by his strange desires and fetishes (bloodswapping, genderbending and much weirder, and not meant to be known by anyone, things). Lastly, the girls gave him information already \"filtered\" by their own delusions (for example, Copycat is convinced Karkat ♥ Equius, Terezi ♥ Eridan and Kanaya - Sollux).\n\nOphiuchus' \"headcanon\" evolved and mutated so much the vision he has of each Twelvie is barely recognizable.\n\nHe doesn't know anything. He isn't aware of anything. He's making shit up at the speed of a Psiioniic-powered ship, like some parts of the Homestuck fandom which clearly are not in any way a major inspiration for his character.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n</FONT>\n",

Almost everything there is to know about the characters was decided at the beginning.\nAnother part of the planning was the main plot and the subplots, and the way they were all going to intermix into an united structure.\n\nHeavy and early planning looks like a necessary part of any SBURBdventure. There are motifs in Hussie's work, motifs one needs to understand and to reproduce in order to emulate SBURB's mechanisms. You need to know who is the Hero of Space because they will have both the temple and the forge near their house. You need to make sure there are both Time and Space Players. You need to know which Players grew cradled by the Horrorterrors and which ones spent their dream life contemplating the prophetic clouds of Skaia.\nI needed to analyse the game, to read other analyses and to have brainstorming sessions with other readers. I had the chance to be helped by BobIsOnlyBob, who takes a special interest in all kinds of recurring motifs (like the fact the Consorts of the Kids are all amphibians). \n\nDespite all of this careful preparation, and sometimes the appearance of pure, untamed railroading, interactivity is a preoccupation. \n\nOne could sum up the interactivity in six categories:\n1 - [b]The inoffensive choices[/b]. They are multiples and usually, they are just different roads leading to the same result with different flavors. For example, at the beginning of the adventure, Vamuin had the choice between hunting FIREDOGS, EQUINELATERALS or APOCALIZARDS, three entirely different species of musclebeasts living each in their own environment - forest, meadows, desert. Another incarnation of it was the choice to talk to Via when our beloved surfer comes back to his hive. Vamuin's three remaining quadrants, Via, Wey and Hem, were [i]all [/i]designed to place him on the \"Tozy murder\" case and to kick his ass. If Wey had been chosen, the same basic informations would have been delivered. But the flavor would have been extremely different (without much influence on the main story).\n2 - The prototyping. Very special moment. I usually don't plan prototyping, the choice is left to the readers/players. I just select the commands leading to the most elegant consequences in my own opinion.\n3 - The dangerous choices/trials/battles. They are many. They can trigger big repercussions on the adventure. A recent example is [url=./Alabaster.html?p=412]Batori's options in one of her Makeup Mode panels[/url]. The Drone would never have been met if she had gone directly to the left (directly to Wey's troglodyte hive). There was an hidden clue in this picture allowing the readers/players to guess the \"correct\" path. Some details are really here to lead the character.\n4 - The plain trap. What game would be complete without some cruel, arbitrary traps only meant to destroy the unfortunate souls opening the wrong door? \n5 - The usual suggestions. Regularly, readers/players find things which go pretty well with the story... Vamuin \"Dive\", for example, so I would be pretty stupid to refuse suggestions this good... A lot of unplanned things happened in general happiness. Au fond, I'm open to any text command.\n6 - The minigames. That's one of the reasons which make me sad about abandoning the planned Flash parts for Alabaster... The minigames were meant to make the adventure funnier, lighter and more interactive.\n\nOf course, sometimes, things aren't this simple. When Ginneo had the choice between four elemental roads, two of them were \"dangerous choices\" (Earth and Fire, leading to dead ends and placing the character in a very bad situation, with a clear chance of being mutilated) and two were easy roads (Wind and Water), just two different flavours to reach the same point (the end of the floor and the Silent Hive minigame).\nAnother thing to note is while this story is about people walking towards horrible ends, a wrong choice resulting in brutal death of a main character looks like bad narration and bad gameplay to me. Generally, when you make the wrong choice, when you commit an error, I have other ways to make it influence the story. Do you remember how the Nursery Circuit was full of traps? I didn't plan for any of these traps to kill or even deeply mutilate Ginneo. I planned different levels of funny or cruel handicaps, most of them being temporary. Since the readers/players only committed one error (near the end, missing the meaning of the number \"1\" in Goldie's letter), you saw only one of these handicaps, the destruction of the cellphone paw: ./Alabaster.html?p=230 .\n\nAlabaster is not this rigid, because an extremely rigid structure is not this solid. Flexibility in the way it's read/played is amongst the appeals of the work for me. Not the main appeal, because soon enough, this adventure will be finished and will mainly become a story for people to read, but a big appeal nonetheless.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How is there a lusus strong enough to simply wipe a drone like that? It's like Glubby the hedgehog?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The question is large enough to deserve a lot of answers! Complementary answers.\n\n1) Let's remember that, rather independently of their appearance, custodians are apparently calibrated to the strength/dangerousness of the troll, by necessity, natural compatibility and/or a lifetime of cohabitation. Aurthour, for example, may look nice, friendly and tiny compared to other companions of the Twelvies, but he is defined as \"one of the strongest lusus species on the planet\".\nGinneo was an efficient troll. Quick, strong, without any hesitation to kill, with good instinct, reflexes, and he loved his murder. The man was able to beat the shit out of other trolls (usually equipped with dangerous weapons) using rattles.\nSo if we deduce Goldie's abilities from Ginneo's, his original appearance may not be any indication of his strength or efficiency.\n\n2) Nothing is invincible, and there is a good chance Drones aren't.\nThey must be very resistant in order to cull adult trolls, though. My interpretation can be found directly in the narration of Alabaster, during the very scene where Ginneo discovers the Drone's body:\n\"It's not supposed to happen. Drones are conceived to eliminate young trolls if necessary (and some categories are even programmed to annihilate adults trespassing). That is not an easy task, and you have never heard of anyone defeating an Imperial model!\"\nGoldie just happened to be stronger.\n\n3) Lusus stronger than Imperial Drones are perfectly possible. In-canon, not speaking about Gl'bgolyb which is the unreachable extremity of the \"badass lusus\" spectrum (were you referring to it with \"Glubby\"?), we know that some trolls have DRAGON lusus. Like Pyralspite.\n\n4) Goldie is a mutant. It is never said or even really suggested in the narration itself since I found it useless and distracting within the story, but the vapors of the OBSCENE Complex modified him in other, darker ways than Ginneo. I'm not only talking about his psychology.\nSpecifically, the normal moulting process of his species has been corrupted. When Ginneo leaves him in his respiteblock, Goldie is starting his moulting, but Ginneo doesn't notice anything and so neither do we.\nIn the picture we can see at the beginning of Silent Hive then in [url=./Alabaster.html?p=392]a brief flashback panel[/url], Goldie is crying tears of blood and seems to suffer from a nosebleed too. It's a picture of his moulting process.\n\n5) Goldie is a hedgechick. Not a hedgebird, a hedgeCHICK. He looks tiny, young. He seems to be either a very young creature by the standards of his species or a neotenic animal. The moulting could be a part of his normal growth, or a reaction to special circumstances, just like when an axolotl evolves into a salamander. So if some of you ask yourself why Goldie suddenly got so big, here is a simple answer: maybe he simply grew up.\nThis possibility isn't opposed to the mutation idea. They can even combine: the vapors either triggered or messed with the growing/moulting process.\n\n6) There isn't a 100% chance that Goldie is Pail Head. Of course, that's the simplest, sanest possibility, and it would explain his white costume (it could be his original external layer, torn and hitched up). But there is another possible explanation: Pail Head could be the lovechild of Goldie and the drone. The forbidden offspring of an animal and a machine. Of course, it's impossible, this isn't rational in any possible way, and I won't attempt to explain it. But I like this idea, it has the perfume of some old horror movie, twisted tale, or stupid myth. \n\n7) Please remember we never see either Goldie nor Pail Head in Cine Mode, the only representation mode really depicting what is happening without any overstylized or delusional filter. The way they are drawn can give you a general idea, but these drawings are very tricky. Don't trust your eyes! Especially in Pail Head's case. Ginneo is permanently under the influence of antediluvian slime vapors, and he got closer and closer to the Forbidden Zone during his chapter, until he fell into it ([i]Silent Hive[/i]). Of course there isn't a thousand Pail Heads. But maybe Pail Head doesn't even look really like he does. Maybe it's just Good Old Goldie with a silly mask, wanting to scare Ginneo away. Who knows?\n\n\nA lot of things are blurry... fuzzy with Goldie and/or Pail Head. This is deliberate.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What made you want to tell stories?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">There is no meaningful event or element, at least not to my knowledge. When I started telling stories, I was too young to remember the details.\n\nBut there is reasons why I KEPT telling stories.\n\nThe main one is I just do it.\nLike I said, I started telling stories before even knowing what the hell I was doing. I was a very instinctive child.\nAnd before this day, I never even thought about what made me want to tell stories. Seriously. It's so integral to me I never thought about it.\n\nThe second one is I need it.\nWhen I don't make any narration work, even for a week, I feel bad. If I wait longer, I feel really bad. It has to do with doing constructive things, but it's also an even deeper need.\n\nThe third one is I like it.\nIt is an almost incomparable pleasure for me to do most of the things related to narration. I like to draw, but writing novels and shooting short movies is even better. Those two are two different pleasures, the writing is instantaneous, intuitive, and directly pleasurable, and the shooting is stronger and more vivid, it's about doing good work, staying concentrated, being careful about everything. \n\nThe fourth one is it looks philosophically/spiritually meaningful to me.\n(Parts of my reflections on the subject are inspired by Jonathan Carroll's masterpiece [i][u]From The Teeth of Angels[/u][/i]. That's a book everyone should read at least once in their life. That's a short book. Seriously, read it.)\n\nThe fifth one is you like it. \nI don't think the only important thing about a story is how it pleases the author. By definition, a story is told. It implicates two persons: the writer and the reader. \nSo I'm extremely glad a lot of people enjoy my stories and if all the previous reasons didn't exist, I would be probably still be narrating anyway.\n\nThe final reason is they just keep coming to me.\nSeriously, the stories themselves just come knocking at my door all the time. \"Hey, you should tell me!\".\nWith Alabaster... Alabaster was on my threshold, shirt open, with a seductive look and a rose between its teeth, \"[color=#045FB4]Co°me o°n baby yo°u kno°w yo°u'll enjo°y it![/color]\".</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]With it being revealed that each Denizen has a Choice to offer his/her player and they are in fact more than mere bosses, it appears that you were actually right on the money with your interpretation of them. How does that make you feel?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Satisfied and reassured. But not too satisfied, it was simple deduction work, and so I don't deserve the deerstalker hat. Mainly reassured, I think.\n\nWhile I'm careful about not contradicting the original work, I worry sometimes about things established in canon suddenly becoming unreliable information. The trolls' understanding of the game, for example, was our first generous data source about SBURB's mechanisms. Until it was revealed as flawed. And perhaps worse, it was revealed to be flawed by Doc Scratch, who can also be considered quite an unreliable source!\n\nTimes like this reassure me about my approach to Hussie's work. I may not be calibrated to his precise wavelength, but... let's say it's close enough.\n\nI also integrated the new data about Denizens to my planning. It won't influence much things, but it will have some impact.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I was a bit surprised to see DG?. I would have expected that all of the Prospitians would have committed mass suicide by now. I mean sure they're usually doomed anyway, but... not like this.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I don't understand the use of the DG acronym, are you talking about divergentGod/Dred-Gani?\nI suppose you got confused between the names. Let's suppose you are talking about IP, the Indefatigable Plenipotentiary, the only Prospitian we've seen for now.\n\nWell, for a start, the Doomed Session doesn't look that doomed for now! Vamuin must seem to the Light Kingdo... excuse me, to the Coruscant Sovereignty, like a very efficient if quite strange Hero.\nProspit and Derse don't know all of SBURB's mechanisms. In the canon story, in [i][u][S] Seer: Descend[/u][/i], Rose Lalonde can find a very interesting tome: \"[i]This is a book on theoretical physics, and complex spatial geometries based on the hypothetical addition of orbs to the queen's ring. The shapes in the diagrams are very complex. This sort of nonsense is regarded as crackpottery at best. Why would the queen ever wear more than four orbs? Four towers, four orbs, four heroes; this is a sacred truth[/i]\".\nIt seems to be an affectionate reference to fandom theories about what the trolls' battlefield looked like (especially since it's next in the library to a White Queen erotic fanfiction!), but it also indicates Prospitians don't know there is other possibilities than the current session. They may not even know they are just a copy of a system amongst an infinity of others, identical data getting modified by the players' course. So I don't think they know about doomed timelines either. They are tailored to try to protect Skaia, and to fail in their mission, because they start with loaded dice. \n\nSo for now, Prospitians only know of the entire Dersite bestiary turning telepathic (because their King and Queen also acquired those abilities) and of the first Player seeming to be a very able fighter.\nThe monarchs know of some more troubling things, mainly the unholy content of Vamuin's cellphone. Kings and Queens are currently trying to wipe their memories.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]...How can you hack a giant bubble glubbed up by the Horrorterrors that appears to exist for at least as long as the there are active dream-selves around? I mean, it's not like Vamuin and friends could even handle a regular Session.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">It doesn't seem perfectly logical... for now, because you don't know the in-universe reason why Vamuin was \"allowed\" to \"hack\" the session.\n\n... Wow, that was a frustrating answer, let's at least give the extradiegetic explanations!\n\nFirstly, the Doomed Session had to be perfectly secondary and to \"almost respect canon\", so the simplest way to do it was to make it a copy of the game from Sollux's data.\nTook this chance to imagine what SBURB's Debug Mode could look like. Not only was this funny, it also provided an excuse to change a lot of parameters, spicing up the story. One will also have more fun without secret overpowered extra lifes, guides from the future or any kind of afterlife!\n\nSecondly, I needed a simple way to show how Vamuin's arrogance screwed up the entire session. He keeps fucking with the game in a infinite number of ways, but most of them are summed up or just plain hypertext.\nThe story needed at least [i]one[/i] scene the reader could look at and think: \"[i]That's not how it works. That's not a good idea. You're doing it wrong, so wrong. What the fuck is your problem?[/i]\"\n\nFinally, the main reason why the SGRUBrip thing is here is [u][i]Earthbound[/i][/u], a NES game which was a major inspiration for the original [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] (right down to the title).\nThere are several games with a very strange \"protection from piracy\" system. Rather than just keeping the software from working, these games add a deficiency turning the game impossible to finish. One recent occurrence is [u][i]Batman Arkham Asylum[/i][/u], where the title character's cloak just doesn't work and keeps sending him crashing to the ground).\nSo an extremely famous incarnation is [u][i]Earthbound[/i][/u]. [u][i]Earthbound[/i][/u]'s protection is amongst the most sadistic ones.\nThe game seems to be running fine, but there are \"subtle\" changes (the major one is the difficulty is raised up to the point you can't take a step without fighting a monster), and more important, at the very end of the game, when you face the final boss after this excruciating adventure, the screen freezes and the game deletes all of your saves before shutting down.\nThat is a legendary and very violent measure. Basically, at the precise moment you start a pirate version of [u][i]Earthbound[/i][/u], the entire adventure is [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmyoV1bkXNI]DOOMED TO FAIL[/url].\n</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I would contest that Skaia doesn't judge. I mean gods are definitely judged, and the fates that befell the canon trolls have a certain tinge of justice to them. Of course, given the interference of Doc Scratch, it's hard to tell if that's how it should be[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">God Tiers are a... complicated matter. If we look at Doc Scratch's explanations (\"[url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&p=005693][i]Nor had he tasted notoriety[/i][/url]\"), \"heroic\" and \"just\" deaths seem to be more about reputation, similar to a video game karma system, than about real virtues.\nThe trolls are an even more delicate subject. The best analysis I read about this was (roughly) \"[i]If you don't grow up, you die, since the game and the story are both about growing up[/i]\", but one could voice some very serious objections to it, starting with Tavros who DID evolve - if only in his dumb, sad, unlucky way, challenging a God Tier Player alone.\nIt seems reasonable enough to not care about either Skaia judging or not judging in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i]'s context, though. That's nothing of importance here. Yes, we are following \"[i]the most selfish, arrogant and depraved trolls in all paradox space[/i]\", and yes, they fucked with SGRUB using this pirate version, but they are going to meet their doom because of other elements (amongst them, the very fact they are extremely careless).</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Actually if the mention of \"omnipotent dog\" and \"yellow yard\" are any indication, Prospitians know the future of the Session as it will be, not how it should be. So even though this Session is Doomed so long as it is a Doomed Alpha, Prospit should see it.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">If we are getting this deep into Prospitian literature, let's examine the exact description of the book you quoted.\n\n\"[i]You find an ancient unlabeled tome, and read an excerpt.\n'Though we adore Him we shall never enjoy His beauteous Croak. We spill our blood on acres of black and white so they may cross the yellow yard. At last in Skaia's reflection through broken glass He may find the pond in which He's meant to squat.'[/i] \"\n\nAnd also some context from two other books:\n\n\"[i] 'Journey to the Center of the Battlefield'.\nLooks to be a fairy tale for youngsters. The hero is a dashing young man in a blue hood. He heals the planet from within, but can do nothing to stop its annihilation from above, nor its soon to follow eradication from reality. It must be sad growing up in a culture whose mythology is centred almost completely around futility.[/i]\"\n\n\"[i] 'Rise of the Slayer'\nA horror story meant to scare children.\nWriters of Prospitian fiction tend to write what they see in the clouds. Hence their fables tend to be events which simply haven't happened yet, or happened in another realm. They like to use the word fiction so that kids don't get TOO scared.[/i]\"\n\n\n\nWhat can we deduce from these tomes?\n\nFirstly, the Kingdom's cultures are entirely SBURB-centered. They have the clear objective, in gameplay terms, to provide the Players a lot of information (which in [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] narration isn't so much delivered by them, it's instead given mainly by time travelers, omnipotent entities and the previous Players) in order to help them to understand their magical adventure and their destiny.\n\nSecondly, the data they relay this way must be essentially delivered to them via the prophetic clouds of Skaia. They must have a reliable way to recognize some of the information directly related to their session (if the \"[i]They Wait[/i]\" banners, in the very same room, are any indication), but it's a fair bet to think they don't know everything. If they did, their literature would look really different and they would also be a lot more present around the Player. The only Caraperson person for now we've seen directly accompanying the Player was the Wizardly Vassal, and the least we can say about him is that he isn't a very typical Carapeople. And also a Dersite.\n\nThirdly, they just don't act like people who know the future. Remember the way things ended for Prospit? Even if we suppose Prospitians have DNA-implemented urges to just keep trying and protecting (think about Jack Noir's hate of frogs), and also, maybe, to behave in a rather inefficient way (since they are literally made to lose)... Don't you think Prospitians would have behaved a little differently if they had known everything about it?\nIf the Carapeople as a whole knew about the future, SGRUB's Jack Noir would never have helped the trolls about to exile him, and SBURB's Wayward Vagabond (again) would not worry about John's death on the Quest Bed.\nIf the Prospitians as a whole knew about the future, the Parcel Mistress would not have been pickpocketed and manipulated, etc.\n\nFinal conclusion: Prospitians don't know more about the future than what they randomly see in the clouds, and since the clouds can show other sessions, universes or timelines, they really must have a hard time figuring what will be going on exactly.\nThe White Queen might know a bit more, but even her knowledge doesn't seem perfect.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How do you feel about Hussie being so coy with the Horrorterrors? I mean it seems like the Noble Circle would have their tentacles all over this, but they're still an enigma. We still don't know what they want, what rules they are bound by etc.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">There could be three equally good reasons why the Horrorterrors aren't so explored (for now) in canon.\n\n- Like Dad or Mom, they could be meant as simple archetypes and nothing more.\n\n- Like the Denizens, they could become incredibly relevant incredibly later in the story.\n\n- There are so many solid concepts in Homestuck it's only logical that, for a lot of them, the narration will never have the time needed to unwrap their full potential.\n\nNo matter what is the correct answer (maybe a fourth), Hussie may, simply, not be this interested in these classical Eldritch Horrors at all.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Are you worried about how complex the King/Queen is going to be by the end of the adventure? I can only imagine how tough that thing will be to draw[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Do I have a real chance to turn the monarchs into interesting, elegant creatures rather than stupid magma of prototype parts? Only time will tell!</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]About how set are you on the course of this adventure? Like I kind of doubt you intend to finish before the hiatus, so what will you do if the Big Man throws some fastballs? Ignore it, or modify your plans?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Just like I am not opposed to (very minor) retcons of [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] in order to stay true to canon, I usually integrate new canon reveals to the plot as they come. Most of Hussie's concepts are so good that when I throw them into my fanwork's planning, they immediately trigger a lot of related ideas. Seriously, most of the time, these fastballs are more stimulating than annoying.\nSo if the fastballs are related to SBURB's game mechanics, I am likely to modify my plans for the best.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]...Lovecraft -and- Discworld? Who told you you could be this cool? Also how would you say Lovecraft and Pratchett have inspired you?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Inspiration is a tough question when you're working on stories like I do.\n\nEarlier, I indicated I develop characters and details of the plot organically, letting my instinct do the hard work of tossing, classifying and synthetizing. Well, that's equally true when talking about influences. \nI think my job as a writer and more generally as an artist is to absorb an extreme number of influences (no matter what influences, travel, daily experiences, fictions, classical painting, abstract art, no matter) and to do extensive research.\nThen I just let my brain and desires do the hard work to shape all the material of my life and tastes into stories, while trying to pay attention to consistency, characters and atmosphere all the time. \nThere must be other ways, but it's probably the most simple and enjoyable, while staying serious.\nIn this synthetizing process, let's say all this raw material is an ocean, and major influences are islands. The islands stay mainly hidden under the sea, part of it, one could say, but their summit is out of the water. \nLovecraft is one of these islands. Sometimes he's just on the skyline and I have a hard time noticing it, sometimes I'm on one of his beaches when I start thinking about the story. \nBut I usually try to keep the influences subtles and almost anonymous.\n\nUsually.\n\nThere are exceptions. When I find a work has been an enormous influence in one of my stories, I can underline it, making it an homage in order to show my gratitude to the original work. I usually love making little references to some things, too (like the Gernika horse).\n\nAnd naturally, in [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]'s special case, my relation to the influences is different. Rougher, more direct. It is a fanwork and a hobby. I don't have to stay so serious all the time about synthetizing the influences... If I want to insert a tiny [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] adventure inside the story, I can do so. If I want a Denizen to look like a Lovecraft-based [u][i]Zelda[/i][/u] boss, I can do so. Etc. Time to have some fun.\n\nIn a horror-themed SGRUB session such as [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u], Lovecraft's influence was doomed to be extremely important. Most of the ways he inspired [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] aren't visible yet, but you'll notice them, believe me.\n\nPratchett counts less for me, emotionally and artistically. Intellectually, I honestly think his writing is better, I love his characters, his world and I always laugh when reading his books, but deep under all these qualities, I personally feel less affinity with him.\nMaybe I'll make some references to him, too. Who knows.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I can not see the relation between OCTOPIXELEMENTAL and his name. Could you help me?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">OCTOPIXELEMENTAL is just his name in Pixelemental logs.\n\nIn the canon story, the sprite conversations are called \"Spritelogs\" and the names of the sprites follow their usual format (NANNASPRITE or DAVESPRITE), while we have just the first name of the kids (JOHN or ROSE).\n\nIn Alabaster, the sprite names aren't formatted this way. The ~SPRITE format only appears in this kind of conversation (and of course, since the language level is modified, it is ~PIXELEMENTAL). DREDPIXELEMENTAL. GANIPIXELEMENTAL. And now, OCTOPIXELEMENTAL.\n\nThe entire name of Ginneo's sprite is \"Octolon\".\n\nIt is a derivative of \"Oktolon\", the German name of the [url=http://www.kamaz.fr/fichiers/images_videos/rainbow-bunchie-v10233.jpg]Bunchie[/url] ( one of the things Ginneo prototyped his sprite with), a pun on the Latin root \"Octo\" (\"Eight\", aka the number of the sprite's limbs) and a play on the word \"long\" (which is pronounced exactly like \"lon\", in French).\nI really hesitated between plain Oktolon, Oktolong, Octolong and Octolon, but finally found the latter to be the most \"dirty\" looking, in a strange way. \"Octolon\" is really an uncomfortable word to me, and so it became the obvious choice.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Soooo, you basically named Ginneo's sprite after a derpy domo llama thing?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">\nYep!\n\nActually, the Bunchie thing is an \"error\".\nI usually don't use memes.\nThis is part of the reasons why there are no \"stairs\" or \"big man\" jokes in [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]. I like how the whole Homestuck story doesn't use existing memes, but rather creates its own, simulating some kind of Internet microcosm, and of course innocent fun and recurring jokes between friends. But even the Homestuck memes are not worthy of being used in my opinion.\n\nWhen I started to make Ginneo's respiteblock (by the way, this room is probably the reason why I am answering you on a padded keyboard in a padded cell), I searched for the most horrible things the depths of Internet could contain. It wasn't always nice. There were entire websites of things I was decently not about to use. But during my search, I noticed Ann, a Skype contact of me, had an avatar of Rainbow Bunchie. By then, I didn't know the Bunchie, for real. I just thought \"Hey, this pic is traumatizing, let's add it\".\nSo a meme found his way into [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] without me knowing it.\nAnd when so many readers voted for the Bunchie prototyping, I had a dilemma. It would for sure make the sprite look better (and by better, I mean worse). But it was a meeeeme.\n\nFinally, I found a compromise between the readers' space of freedom and my despise of memes. I kinda erased the Bunchie. More precisely, it got almost entirely dissolved into the obscene pileup that is this sprite. The sprite was too heavy in details anyway, I didn't have the place to make all the parts appear.\nBut I had to find a name, and it felt cool to allow some recognizable part of the Bunchie. So Octolon it was.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Are Ophiuchus's horn's natural or has he been adding on to them?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">They are almost entirely artificial, hollow, made of a composite material unique to Alternia, close to our fiberglass. They extend to a thick corset enclosing his torso. The whole structure maintains him above the ground, and also works as a carrossery for clockwork mechanisms, linking the toy key in Ophiuchus' back to the motorized casters allowing him to move.\n\nThe way Ophiuchus moves is truly something to behold.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Do the sprites still have a \"second\" tier? As in, can they choose to throw more stuff into it without it affecting all the monsters?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Indeed, after the Entry, the sprites can still merge with more items. But since they seem to glitch/to be disturbed if they are prototyped too many times, that may not be the smartest thing to do.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]So was the double rainbow meme a mistake too?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Oh yes, totally!\n\nI could \"correct\" it, except I avoid retcons when they are not absolutely necessary to correct a complete mistake, keep in touch with the canon or preserve the consistency. My personal tastes should not be a reason.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I finally got to reading this adventure and i'm all like O: combined with the hiatus i'm extremely antsy so more Alabaster pl0xx[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Do not worry, for this adventure is blessed with a violently fast update frequency.

So I have a hard time separating them from the entire narrative process.\n\nSome people develop characters in a more \"isolated\" way, sometimes planning them entirely and very precisely before starting the story. I tried it in the past, writing like ten pages of biography and then two more pages detailing all the characteristics.\nI discovered the hard way this kind of preparation is limitative, and deadly to my interest for the story. Maybe it works for other people. It doesn't work for me. I write maybe ten lines on the character, then I start the real writing.\n\nThe protagonist is mainly a part of the story for me.\n\nConsequently, the only creation stage I can identify, and the only pleasure I can quantify, is the visual design.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]This isn't the land of fur and abortion![/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Oh yes, I was going to make Ginneo's SGRUBrip planet the Land of Fur and Abortion because he is a babyfur. Also Batori's will be the Land of Blood and Rainbow, Sectra's the Land of Main Twelve and Binoculars, and I'm thinking about retconning Vamuin's into the Land of Sun and Surf.\n\nAll of this is so surprising, graphically stimulating and narratively interesting.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I don't know about you, but Land of Main Twelve and Binoculars sounds awesome.

It felt like home. The first [u][i]Slient Hlil[/i][/u] was obviously more of an homage and synthesis of Knig's work than anything else, with some other meaningful cultural influences, like [u][i]Jaocb's Larded[/i][/u]. It was amazing, a deeply fascinating story. And something else was there too, deep inside the entrails of the masterpiece, in a larval state, not unlike the squalid embryos the story was fond of. The Japanese conception of ghosts and demons, more organic, dirty, \"unfair\" than anything we have here. These codes started to infect the entire narration, and worked well with some Loverfatcian influence and the supposedly Native American mythology of the town to create a unique setting.\n\n[u][i]Slient Hlil[/i][/u], the place where your inner demons truly come to life. The place which entirely reflects the deepest turmoil. The place where ancient gods still answer to the prayers of those who know how to please them.\n\nI could write entire books on this series and there would still be a lot of ground to cover. Misty, unholy ground.\n\nIn a fanwork, I can express my love for some influences in larger ways than I allow myself to do in more serious stories. So. [u][i]Slient Hlil[/i][/u].\n\n\nBut there is also another aspect to consider... [u][i]Albaestar[/i][/u] is a panorama of imaginary horror. Almost all of the characters will meet a different kind of horror.\n\nIt just so happens that Ginneo is the first to encounter his special kind of horror, and it is [u][i]Slient Hlil[/i][/u] and the [u][i]Slient Hlil[/i][/u] kind of story (aka \"Mindfuck stories\").

Plus Doc Scratch apparently died with the entire blue universe.\n\nSo, by all accounts, the poor Jack is suddenly changed down to unlucky canon fodder. He's an out-of-date product.\n\nOne can only assume our heroes will have to face either an extraordinary coup-de-théâtre or Lord English very soon. Maybe both.\n\nPlus the Scratch happened, and supposedly retconned the entire Kids' universe (unless the Tumor bomb even erases the reborned universe).

That is quite sad, since she merely gave Tozy the (good) idea of buying something shiny for his little male bimbo. He thought about Renart's horn jewelry himself. But she feels guilty, and that's not all there is to it.\n\nWe learn the very fact Tozy was going to buy something FOR VAMUIN, too.\nIn the previous conversations ([url=./Alabaster.html?p=97]the first one here[/url] and [url=./Alabaster.html?p=99]the second one there[/url]), we first received the information he was going to see a guy \"very talented with horns\" and later, that he was going to \"buy something\".\n\nWe can also see in this new conversation Tozy was not so innocent towards Vamuin's feelings and way of life. He knew his matesprit. He knew how Vamuin was going to react to the \"Leaving for the hive of this nice guy, byebye\" message. Did he know about Vamuin's infidelities? We don't know, he probably SUSPECTED it. Vamuin is a deceiver, but he doesn't have half the manipulation talents he thinks he has.\n\nNonetheless, Tozy loved Vamuin, and he was ready to forget all about treachery. Was it a wise decision?

We've seen most of the powers of First Guardian-prototyped persons to benefit from the Green Sun boost.\n\nBut Sunburn Eyes works by eye contact. He only can burn (and, with overkill, explode) something he makes eye contact with. Not sure how it would be \"empowered\" by the Green Sun. Maybe the effect would be quicker? Maybe he normally gets a little exhausted when using it, but could do it with infinite juice after greensunification? Could this insufferable Gary Stu/munchkin ever need MORE power?

They are closely related to the very ways destiny (and narration) are at work here.\n\nVamuin left the Dreamselves enabled, though. For three reasons, two intradiegetic, one extradiegetic:\n1) When using the normal Quest Cocoon, a Player needs their Dreamselve to reach God Tier. There is no way Vamuin is going to say \"No\" to even more power, not to forget immortality.\n2) \"The moon thing\".\n3) Dreamselves allow the narration to kill almost each Player two times.\n\nAnd like DS Piron noticed on the forum, Vamuin also left Sleeping Beauty Mode enabled, literally \"because frenchkissing is hot\".\n\nDreambubbles are out of the picture. The Players use their Dreamselve as an extra life, then they die for real.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]You said the Adventure would last approximately 600 pages...[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Yep. People can be naive like that sometimes.\n\nLet's see what Hussie wrote about this kind of problem [url=http://andrewhussie.blogspot.com/2009/11/interrogative-remarks-followed-by.html]back in 2009[/url]:\n\n\"[i]EVERYTHING WILL TAKE LONGER THAN YOU THINK IT WILL, ALWAYS.[/i]\"</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Do you have any other ideas for adventures once Alabaster is over?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I think it will be the end of the road for me. The adventure format is extremely interesting, it is a mix of pure experimentation, entertainment and art training. But I am not motivated to spend a lot of time and energy in other adventures afterwards. I have other narrative approaches to explore (or to go back to).\n\nDon't worry, I will link you to my non-adventure works. I'm keeping contact with all of you, both the authors and the readers. You are an extremely lovable, diverse, cultured and surprising community.\nI'm going to leave adventures, yes, probably forever, yes, but I'm also going to stay in touch.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]You've got a pretty good handle on 'horror', so what's your opinion on [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006011]Lord English revealing himself[/url]? Also within Alabaster, will there be other incidents of body horror beyond the sad fate of the Underlings, and presumably the Monarchy?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">About English, well, unlike the Denizens' intellect and importance, I can't say I \"called it\" this time.\n\nI thought he was going to be a previous character, and I was betting on some kind of Gamzee/Jadesprite hybrid; then, when I saw the End of Act 5 Flash, my theory entirely changed, I became convinced Lord English was Grandpa.\n\nThere are a lot of things we still don't know about Grandpa, and I was alarmed when re-re-rereading [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002755]this page of Jade's exposition[/url]. It made me think about [url=http://mspandrew.tumblr.com/post/11960418585/about-eoa5-part-3]a post on Hussie's Tumblr[/url]: \"[i]This appears to be a pattern with LE, enslaving various women, who can only die by completing their term of service, and vice versa. He recruited Aradia's and Feferi's ancestors in the same way. From the perspective of LE as a crime boss rather than an immortal demon, he's somewhat like a ruthless pimp. Whoever he is.[/i]\"\n\nSo basically, I thought Grandpa was Lord English, he would use Becquerel's loyalty to him to stop Jade, and Jade would be the next to be enslaved.\n\nAnd even if English is finally revealed to be an original character, I still think she is going to be enslaved. The demon has an habit of enslaving extremely powerful women, and Jade is probably more powerful than the Condesce, Aradiacestor and Snowman together. Plus it's not like she would be the first First (sic) Guardian to work for him. And finally, SOMETHING is going to happen to stop Jade from munchkin-ing her way right to the end, right? All-powerful characters generally don't make very good protagonists, specifically because, well, they are all-powerful. It's not very good for suspense.\n\nI also thought, like almost everyone, that we were going to have a short Intermission, but a real Intermission nonetheless.\n\nFinally, specifically about Lord English's appearance and appearance (sic)...\n\nIt was really creepy. The way the limbs are elongated then thickened, the crackling ball, the claws, the music... Doc Scratch's metamorphosis is impressing.\nOnce can notice we only see Lord English's complete appearance, for now, with extreme brevity. One can compare to the number of frames used to introduce Jade's new design. Hussie specifically chose to show English this way. He didn't do this because the music was short or because he didn't have time to draw many complete frames. He wanted English's screentime to be short here, because the shorter you see a horrific character, the better. Stephen King wrote texts about it, he analyzed Dracula's almost absence from the eponymous novel, for example. You can't show the real horror too much.\n\nThis being said, I'm not the most satisfied by the design. It looks a little too similar to [url=http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5xy73dc8X1qze5g2o1_500.gif]Skeletor[/url] to me. But eh, English is the Master of the Universe after all...\nAnd it IS unhealthy and disturbing. This appearance looks wrong. It certainly concentrates the malevolent demon vibe. So it doesn't work with my personal tastes in monsters, but I have to admit it fulfills its purpose perfectly.\n\n\n\n\nAnd within [u][i]Alabaster[i][/u], yes, there will be other incidents of body horror. Mainly, most of the Denizens will be concentrated body horror. With real fragments of Do-not-want inside!</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]As you interpret things, do characters who ascend to God Tier via the quest bed inside Prospit or Derse's moon require a massive input of energy to make the transformation work? How likely is this to become relevant in Alabaster?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Your interrogation is probably referring to the possibility (indicated by Hussie himself) that Aradia, Dave and Rose's ascensions were fueled by the Green Sun.\nThat is a very interesting question, but I have no means to answer to this. We don't know how rare are the secret-Quest-Beds-hidden-inside-Kingdoms. We don't even know if they are sometimes set inside the two Kingdoms, or only in Derse. We don't know if it is normal for them to be set in the moon like with the Kids. And of course, we don't know if the Green Sun or \"the green flames\" are needed, irrelevant or a threat to the process (in my opinion, they have helped it exactly like a normal death would do, but I wouldn't bet on it).\nWe don't even know how much the process diverges from normal ascension. For example, in the three cases we observed, the usual Player/Dreamself duality, so much needed by the non-secret Quest Beds, is absent. For all we know, a Player could NEED to lose his alter ego before being able to ascend with the secret ones.\nAnother funny question: what happens to the usual Quest Bed normally hidden in the Land? Dave does have one in the Land Of Heat And Clockwork (a doomed Dave tried to use it before getting joyfully jacknoired, remember?). What would have happened if Dave had ascended with this one, and then, deprived from the Player/Dreamself duality, had sacrificed himself on his Derse Quest Bed? WH4T NOW? Double God Tier?\n\n\nThe secret Quest Bed thing is kinda complex. And since [url=./Alabaster.html?p=118]Vamuin disabled the Secret Quest Recuperacoons at the beginning of the adventure[/url], well... All of these reflexions are very likely to stay entirely irrelevant in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i].</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Do you have any speculation on the Homestuck plot you would like to share with us?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Well, first, I must insist on the theory I exposed before: something is going to change for the worst. This future twist is very likely related to Dog Tier Jade. \nPlus the Denizens, and possibly their minions, are going to have a great role.\nWe just can't avoid seeing the post-Scratch (and probably post-Doc Scratch... I mean, the Doc Scratch equivalent in the scratched red universe) Kids, too. \n\nIn more precise ideas... Dave could die, I guess.\n\nKeep in mind most of my deductions will not be more valuable than the ones by any other logically thinking reader.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How many doomed Vannys died in the orgy?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Are you suggesting Vamuin is clumsy enough to break some of his necks during the orgy?

Namely, that the entirety of their society has been arranged by a demon and his entourage to influence and manipulate a handful of trolls which aren't them?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">If this reveal can be used in a tragically powerful way, I will make them realize the origin of the \"troll society\" as they know it. But in the current structure and atmosphere of the story, it appears to me as random and superfluous information.\n\nIt is important for the [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i] trolls because the story revolves a lot around English and what he is doing to universes, around Doc Scratch, around the sad story of the Ancestors, around the cultural differences between the Trolls and the Kids... and also, very probably, around what the post-Scratch human civilization is going to look like. Etc, etc. The Reset and Horrific Reconstruction of Troll Society is big stuff there, serious business. It's linked to a lot of thematics, ambiances and character dynamics.\n\nBut is it important for the [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] trolls, which are more about subcultures, fandoms, egocentrism, egoism, pretending, satire and poetic \"justice\"?\n\nPlus it's hard to care about existentially horrifying revelations when you're being _______ or ______ or _____ while _____ is watching and ______ _______ _______ ____ __________ ______ ____ while screaming __________ _______ _____ _______ _______ ________ _______ _______ ______ ______ _______ ______ ____ __________ _____\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: Oh, of course, Vamuin would be devastated to know both English's gang and the entirety of Paradox Space apparently do not care.\nBut would he believe it? I mean, co°me o°n, the entire multiverse is ab°ut him. O°bvio°usly.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]This is a joke parody about fan trolls right?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\"> This is a joke parody about fan trolls right? \nYes!\n\n\nAlready indicated, you can for example find this line in the [url=?p=2]\"WHAT THE HELL IS AN ALABASTER?\" rubric[/url]:\n\"- Alabaster contains a cast of six Players. These main characters are parodies from existing archetypes/fandoms and fantrolls. \"\n\nLet's dig into this subject.\n\nThe canon trolls are either plain archetypes (Karkat, the \"hedgehog\" kid with a heart of gold, Vriska, the ambiguous Trickster character...), references to pop culture figures (The X-men, Daredevil, Harry Potter...), or incarnations of strange subcultures (muscle-obsessed furries, juggalos, roleplayers, shippers...).\nI also noticed how much canon trolls stayed... trolls. 99% of their logs are about getting the reader, or the interlocutor, or both, disturbed, furious or just seriously sidetracked/derailed. Even in the Alterniabound games and the most drama-filled moments (Karkat speaking to Evil Gamzee), we have huge amount of trolling, in the Internet sense.\n\nThe [i][u]Hivebent[/u][/i]-like tone I was looking for could easily be reached with this kind of approach.\n\nSo I wanted the [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] trolls to be:\n- Modern culture archetypes/incarnations of subcultures\n- Fantrolls parodies\n- Trollesque\n\nFor example, Vamuin is a Surfer Asshole/Gary Stu. Ginneo is a Babyfur/\"Cute one\" (the Nepeta-like fantrolls). You can find some additional explanations on archetypes [url=?p=26]in a previous message, in the answers of August 2011 (search for the tropes question)[/url].\n\nThis is less pure, simple, complete parody and more character development based on archetypes and caricature. There are and will be serious times in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i]. There are even serious characters. For example, Via is only funny when interacting with the assholes, because she's so serious, it's the straight person lost in an ocean of almost palpable stupidity and absurdity.\n\n[i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] is other things, too. A panorama of imaginary horror. A (screwed) pirated version/Perfect Play/Speedrun of SBURB. An action-packed spectacle. A fanwork extrapolating new elements from canon facts, trying to stay consistent.\n\nBut to answer your question once again, basically, the idea is to make fun of fantrolls, yes.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Mirror is down oh noes!

Some of them are probably going to die trying the Double One-Legged Elephant position or whatever.\n\nMore generally, I am not forgetting doomed clones are... well, doomed. Even more doomed than the rest of the cast, since here, we are specifically talking about the way Skaia systematically eliminates the waste products of timelines never meant to be.\n\n\n\nIf you want to be even more reassured about the horrific fate of those Vamuins, you may wish to take a new look at this picture from a recent update:\n\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed857.png[/img]\n\nSee? Don't worry. Their only destiny is death. It's going to be a nice unavoidable massacre.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Ginneo is the Void right? Thats how he got in that glitch world?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">No, the Glitch/Void moment is a reference to this very common video game malfunction where you go through a wall or ground and suddenly fall into an impossible environment.\n\nThe color of the Outside the Map environment may vary. It's generally entirely empty at first sight, although strange effects can be observed, as indicated in [url=http://it-he.org/deus3.htm]the \"Things Never Seen\" Deus Ex walkthrough[/url] :\n\"[i]We are now officially out-of-bounds. You will notice that the floor consists of a fascinating substance which absorbs light, so your headlamps will be of no use.[/i]\"\nSometimes you can see pieces of levels, or reversed levels, or cutaway views of levels, when you are Outside the Map. Sometimes you keep falling through the void ([i][u]Soul Reaver 2[/u][/i]) or swimming into it ([i][u]Tomb Raider Underworld[/u][/i]). Sometimes you do the same thing, but through solid matter.\nOccasionally, Debug Rooms or Warp Rooms (secret spaces created by the development team with various purposes, help for the player, shortcuts for the betatester...) share some properties with the Void, or are linked to it.\n\nThe \"dance\" the puppy teaches to Ginneo is almost the precise manipulation needed to go through a wood training structure in [i][u]Tomb Raider 2[/u][/i], [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOo9IUtQLRc&feature=related]allowing Lara Croft to suddenly teleport on a point she cannot normally reach[/url], and then to jump on the outer wall, and then to reach the void, fake, trompe-l'oeil landscape: \n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/fakelandscape.png[/img]\n\nThe idea of reversing the readers' commands comes from the occasionally \"reversed levels\" you can find when you are Outside the Map, from the \"reversed commands \" you have occasionally in some platformers like [u][i]Rayman[/i][/u] (and [u][i]Silent Hive[/i][/u]...) and from the \"Mirror\" designation for [url= http://mspfanventures.com/]MSPAFA.com[/url].\n(Normally, this site is used to \"mirror\" adventures updated and read on forums. Only a few authors (like me) consider the Mirror as the priority.)\nIt is also a classical image of fantasy stories, going through the mirror.\n\nGinneo dies after some exploration because in a video game, when you are Outside the Map, it's usually the No Return point. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to \"de-glitch\" your character. If he isn't paralyzed or caught in a cycle of impossible moves, you can try to kill him by making him launch grenades or something like it. Sometimes the unnatural, never-meant-to-be environment will do the job for you, your character can explose, disappear or just plainly die. Sometimes you just have to shut down your console or computer.\nHe could have escaped it, I guess, but Armok's command trying to save Ginneo with this peak-like deformation of the forum thread gave me [url=./Alabaster.html?p=812]the most horrible/comical \"reversed intent\" idea[/url]. I just HAD to do it.\n\nAny other Player could have fallen Outside the Map. It is unknown if this kind of bug is possible because it is a pirated, broken session or if you can do it in normal SBURB sessions. It only happened to Ginneo because, like you may have noticed by now, he has ten different kinds of bad luck.\n\n\n\n\nTo answer to another part of your interrogation, Ginneo isn't elementally linked to SBURB's Void (which is, I guess, a totally different thing than the Outside-the-Map/Void/Nowhere I used, even if we never saw Equius using his Heir of Void abilities).\n\nGinneo is the Heritor of Evisceration.\n\nHe was always meant to be linked to this \"Element\"... which isn't as easy to conceive as Time or Breath, but eh, we have precedents for strange, anatomically-linked elements. A Heritor of Evisceration isn't this different from a Knight of Blood or a Rogue of Heart.\nOnly here, we have an action rather than a part of the body. But this action, the \"evisceration\", may be only an elegant way to describe organs in the revised SGRUBrip glossary.\n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/eviscerationsymbol.png[/img]\n\n</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Have you thought about making a TVTropes page for Alabaster? I can think of one trope off the top of my head--Break the Cutie, poor Gin. :c Are there any other tropes you think apply?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">It would be lovely... Maybe I'll do it someday, but I probably won't, at least not right now. Promoting personal projects is already a lot of work and it regularly implies doing similar things, presentations of my stories.\nIt is always a pleasure to do, but for [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i], it sounds a little too much like serious work to me.\n\nIf someone wants to make a page, though, I think we already have Surfer Dude, The Casanova, Badass, Action Hero and a thousand more tropes for Vamuin. Ginneo is a Badass Adorable (I... guess?!), and may be an Ensemble Darkhorse, since I hadn't planned for him to take so much screentime and certainly never thought he would become one of the most popular characters. What happened to the puppy is an \"And I Must Scream\" moment. And I think we can find many other things.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Will there be more opportunities to interact more directly (but not necessarily as directly as in the glitch sequence) than just giving suggestions to characters again?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Yes, there will be. I cannot be more precise than this, sadly.\nThere will also be some entirely uninteractive moments, for multiple reasons, mainly the sake of the plot and its rhythm. When a scene can only trigger obvious suggestions, I will generally make those myself and advance the story quickly.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Your hunch about Lord English was half correct he is called Jake English in the now.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I'm now deeply convinced this theory I thought seriously outdated is true. Think about it.  [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002755]Look at this again[/url].\n\nI was only basing my theory on the fact Lord English was accumulating an entire collection of women. But these are BLUE LADIES. That's a minor catchword in the Kids' arc. Blue ladies.\n\nWe now know the post-Scratch Kids universe has become an empire. A human empire, a TRANSGLOBAL (including multiple planets?) empire. The amount of posters including blue figures in the room of both Scratched Kids is disheartening. So is Jake's reference to GALS OF CERULEAN COMPLEXION.\n\nMy extrapolation, which I'm convinced will soon become more than an extrapolation, is the empire includes colonies of blue-skinned extraterrestrials.\nAnd the DAUGHTERS OF ECLECTICA are from this blue-skinned species.\n\nI think there is an abnormal, somehow sentient continuity between Grandpa and Scratched Grandpa aka Jake English, or some other kind of link. \nH may be like a reversed Sufferer: Grandpa may have inherited the memories of Scratched Grandpa, like the Sufferer inherited the memories of non-yet-Scratched-Sufferer-as-a-SGRUB-Player.\nIf [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] has repeated one concept many times, it is that time is NOT a linear thing. We already have proof the Scratched Kid session can communicate with the Kid session in some ways, if only by the letter and bunny Jake English sent to the Kids.\n\nThink about how Grandpa does look English. Like a colonial (interesting, right?) English lord.\nThink about how his Scratched counterpart, Jake English, does sound English.\n\nNow, with all of it in mind, look at this line in [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006020]Jake English's introduction[/url].\n\"[i]And how you'd give your RIGHT LEG for a shot at desecrating THE SHIT out of some real life MYSTIC RUINS for their byzantine wares.[/i]\"\n\nGuess who doesn't have a right leg left?\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: Of course, I could be wrong. It seems too obvious. Too easy to guess.\nBut in my opinion, Hussie will never screw the logic of the story in order to make the perfect, most unguessable twist. He already did something the fandom had figured he'd do, the Bec prototyping. At this point he explained sometimes, the most obvious things are the best thing to do, storytelling-wise. If it is obvious, it is because it is the most logical turn of events. A story should always try to have a followable logic.\nPlus he has an habit to mock the \"twist\" idea. He did so many times, particularly in [i][u]Hivebent[/u][/i]. I wouldn't be surprised if to Hussie, the way Jake English became Lord English was more important than the fact the reader knows he is Lord English.\n\n\n[ [i]I ended up being wrong: the entire Grandpa/Jake English plot point was revealed to be, or was retconned as, a pure red herring.[/i] ]</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]are the troops of the denizens reasonable people, or just the soldiers.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Is a soldier a reasonable person?

But at least we learned the true meaning of the number 23 in relationship to the Chinese Zodiac. Thank you Solid Snake!\n\nMore seriously.\n\nLike I said earlier, in [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i]'s canon, apparently, the Denizens' Minions are smart enough to steal important items from heroes.\n\nSo some of [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i]'s Minions [\"Lieutenants\"] are going to be very smart. Sometimes smart enough to have human-like intelligence. And since they are quite folkloric, with strongly marked identities, they are more likely to surprise us than, let's say, the Dersites.\n\nIn the case of the Toy Soldiers, they simulate a real army, or at least, an infantile vision of a real army, which is perfectly identical troops (typically, only infantry) without much equipment (not even a backpack) who are mainly going to be sent on nonsensical \"kill'em all\" missions. \nMaybe their reasonable personality comes from a human-like awareness combined with absurd situations. They are not happy with the rules, but as they are also created to be flawlessly lawful, they can only use logic to work their way in this cruel world.\nMaybe this personality is planned from the start, and simply window-dressing to the killing machine.\nWe will presumably never have any real answer to these interrogations, but the important thing to notice here is their intelligence, more than their reason. The Toy Soldiers are smart, very smart.\n\nThere will be other very smart Minions.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Would it be possible for a Dreamself to revive a dead Realself?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Hehehe... Looks like someone here knows how to use their brain.\n\nYeah, it's possible in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] Canon. And probably in [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i] Canon, too.\nThis idea (which came very early in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i]'s planning, it's part of the concepts I found before starting, it's part of the concepts which convinced me to begin this story) is directly originated from the following quote in the late Hussie Formspring:\n\n\"[i]There are only two ways we know of that the dream self can serve as an extra life.\n\n1) The corpse must be kissed by a prince or princess. (Please note, they are technically all princes/princesses of their respective moons.)\n\n2) The player must die on their quest bed/cocoon, in which case their dream self takes over while upgrading to god tier on the battlefield.\n\nThe dream self also takes on the critical wounds sustained by the real self, but in a delayed fashion. Note how dream John began bleeding a little while after he was stabbed. These wounds are healed upon resurrection.\n\nPresumably the dream self will eventually die from the same wounds inflicted on the real self, but after a time delay. This would suggest the player has a pretty brief time limit to complete their resurrection.\n\nWe've only seen three examples of this. John and Vriska, who both died on the quest bed/cocoon, so the time limit didn't matter.\n\nSollux was also resurrected after being kissed by Feferi. This means after he died, she made the trip between her world and his in QUITE A HURRY.[/i]\"\n\nSo I guess for a certain someone, it's now the final countdown!</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Why exactly did vamuin screw Bat's dreamself? I missed the reasoning[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">\"Reasoning\" would imply Vamuin's brain can be relocated outside of his pants for a short moment.\n\n[ [i]This answer was purposefully avoiding the real reason, which wasn't revealed in-story back then. The copulation with Batori's Dream Self was a test to see if a Real Self could be put to sleep at will by copulation with the Dream Self.\nVamuin used this information later to be put to sleep by Batori making love to his Dream Self, which allowed him to access God Tier.[/i] ]</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Can doomed clones appear on the kingdoms, because this \"escapade\" is just the type of fuck up that a VERY DETERMINED clone of Vanny could solve, also can Doomed timeline clones revive alpha players?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I don't see any reason for doomed clones to be unable to reach the Kingdoms (even if they certainly can't wake up as the alpha Dreamself, it would screw the game mechanics), or to lose their ability to give the Kiss of Life. They are still Selenite Princes and Princesses.\n\nSo yes, a Doomed Vamuin could revive Ginneo.\n\nkawaii sugoii otp =^.^=</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I thought Derse forces didn't attack Derse players dreamselves ? At least not when said dreamselves were still in the city and the royalty is in charge? I remember a Hussie Formspring about that. I guess things are pretty different in this session.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Indeed, almost any difference between the canon sessions and the SGRUBrip one can be justified by the fact \"things are different\". The Kids' and Trolls' sessions can't be considered normal. We are lacking reference on both sides.\n\nBut generally, I try to follow strictly the rules as we know them.\n\nHere is the Hussie Answer you were thinking about:\n\n\"[i]QUESTION: If players of Sburb are fighting against the Black Kingdom, then why don't the Dersites kill the Derse dreamers in their sleep? One of my friends keeps asking me this and I can't come up with a decent answer.\n\nANSWER: The conflict between the kingdoms is regimented. There are rules, like in chess, though much more complex. It isn't necessarily all out war, except for what takes place on advanced stages of the battlefield. If the queen is in power, she leaves them alone. Killing them would be improper. If Jack is in power, he clearly has no problem with it.\n\nAnd there's potentially more to it than some kind of etiquette. Though the Derse dreamers are heroes, they still serve as emissaries to the dark gods, who presumably tend to be opposed to the goal of creation, like Derse. There always remains the possibility that the Derse dreamers will carry out the agenda of the gods without understanding what they're doing. To kill those kids before that would lack strategic foresight, something a queen has.[/i]\"\n\nHussie only formally indicated Dersites don't kill the Derse Dreamers in their sleep. They probably aren't authorized to enter the Dream rooms, too...\nBut the limit to Dersites' free will here is fuzzy. For a start, Jack Noir probably wouldn't hesitate to try some friendly stabstabbing if a Derse Dreamer was to fly too close to his office. Or to make them fall down the stairs. \"[i]Accidents happen, my Queen, I didn't even see what happened, I was filling these papers and this kid broke his neck right in front of me.[/i]\"\n\nI think given the current prototypings, Dersite population is probably extremely unhappy to see their leaders to be defiled by such obscene metamorphosis. Could they become more hostile to the Players?\n\nPlus here, we aren't seeing proper Dersites, only Underlings.\nIn [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] canon, the Toy Soldiers know the Kiss of Life thing, but they don't seem to care about Ginneo's Dream Self. So the Minions apparently don't know about the moons and the Dream Selves. Their memory/programming only holds partial information.\nLike Minions, Underlings are supposed to be born in the Lands - at least in the Lands' mythology, according to some NPC dialogues of [S] ACT 4... The Underlings are supposed to be commissionned by Derse and hired/made/summoned/kneaded by the Denizens.\nIf we add to all this data the fact Underlings are definitely not the smartest things and that amongst them, Imps are clearly the cannon fodder of cannon fodder, we can realise together, with overwhelming emotion, that the creatures flying after Ginneo right now probably DON'T UNDERSTAND A DAMN THING.\n\nYes, in my personal opinion, the thoughts of the Imps in the last update are something like \"[i]Uh? Enemy fall from strange high thing? Uh? Enemy fly? Us kill enemy![/i]\"</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Heiritor is not long enough of a title I demand you add more syllables for the glory of the lowbloods.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The Lowblood Language Level is already too close to weakening the story in my opinion.\nIt's an idea born simultaneously from a personal taste for sophisticated language and from a desire to restore some \"ominous babble\" feeling in a fandom where the usual SBURB glossary is already too familiar.\nIt's an idea I still like and find useful.

What changed?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Mainly two things drastically changed the length of the adventure. The Flash moments and the Lands.\n\n\n\nFLASH MOMENTS: HOW THEY SCREWED THINGS UP\n\nI started giving myself a serious limit of 600 panels without animation.\nThen the Flash games and movies started coming to my mind, and can be regarded as an example of how naive I can be regarding my own ambitions.\nQuickly enough, I wanted to have one Flash game for each chapter, and one Flash movie for each Land exposition. Not to mention I even thought about adding tinier Flash games, and two or three short Flash movies for action scenes.\nI could do that if I was Hussie, if it was my own universe. It isn't. [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] may represent a lot of work, but at core, it's still a fanwork.\nToo much effort. Too much time spent on it. These plans had to be revised. In my own interest, passion had to take a backseat to reason. I abandoned the idea and gave an extended explanation about it in this very Formspring.\n\n[i](See the answer [url=?p=26]here[/url], first answer, to the question \"I personal would prefer more and higher quality content no matter what the delay (...)\".)[/i]\n\nBut like I also indicated, not only were these Flash bonuses too much effort (but I regret nothing, particularly for [i][u]Silent Hive[/u][/i]), they had the secondary effect of slowing down the adventure. Both Ginneo's journey through the OBSCENE Complex (chapter 2) and the chaotic moment when we never stop trying new characters and end up playing Copycat (beginning of chapter 3) were part of the plan, but they were planned to be WAY shorter. They turned into fillers, sorta. Sure, they helped me to place a lot of useful information, but that's still a lot of panels which don't really contribute to advance the story.\nI thought the change of pace after Vamuin's Entry would be enough to compensate the fact nearly half the story had been spent in Alternian shenanigans BEFORE the aforementioned \"Doomed Session\". But I quickly understood I was wrong. It wasn't the right way to tell the story. I couldn't spend so much time on parts which were honestly almost \"prologue and filler\" to me and then wrap up the entire plot and subplots in 300 panels.\nSo nope. Finishing the story this quickly was out of question.\n\n\n\nLANDS: HOW THEY SCREWED THINGS UP.... FURTHER!\n\nOriginally, the Lands (oh, sorry, the \"Territories\") were going to be decor... literally plain scenery behind the Players' actions, and even not a lot of graphical work. For example, I thought I could paint a concert room photography in orange tones for Vamuin, copy/paste some metronomes, and here we go, a nice little background, always the same, for all of the Lands. I thought maybe ten panels would be spent in the Consort quests, levelgrinding and puzzles for each Land. I only cared about the plot and about my beloved abominable Denizens, right?\nRight?\nNonetheless, the more I thought about these strange planets tailored to a Player's psychology and mythological role, the more ideas were invading my mind, ideas about [i][u]Problem Sleuth[/u][/i]-like video game parody, ideas about the fake history of each Land, and also purely aesthetic ideas like huge stainglass-decorated metronome towers, aerial canals carrying pomegranate juice, mirroring marble bridges, a Mozart partition of light in a golden sky.\nI must add I'm lying a little here. I'm simplifying things in order to make you understand how my vision evolved. I always thought I would spend some time working on the Lands, only... not so much. Really not so much.\n\n\n\n... So, yes, [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] is taking longer and longer because:\n1 - I want the most interesting part of the story to be by far the longer part,\n2 - I apparently turned into a dirty landophiliac.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: About the incoming hiatus... I don't forget I once wrote \"a little hiatus wasn't happening, because I'm always trapped under a huge pileup of projects and I have already the [i][u]Rotting[/u][/i] adventure on hiatus\". When I'm talking about hiatus, it's a matter of days, or a matter of weeks, maybe two weeks.\nAnd that's hoping I'll even do a real hiatus and not the most useless, random Intermission (INTERMISSION?

Are you trying to teach us uncontrolled sex urges are a very bad thing?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">No.\nI'm a free mind about sexuality. By \"traditional American values\", I guess I could be seen as downright libertine. Hell, even by \"traditional French values\", I am.\nAnd it can look paradoxical, but I also have strict morals about sex. Only they don't follow most western traditions.\n\nFor example, I think any human being could use a lot of intercourse with various partners before engaging in any kind of serious, chronic relationship related to sex. \n\nEveryone has a personal sexual identity. Frequency differs (some people make love six times a day to feel happy, other ones are happy one time a month), rhythm differs (do you like it slow, quick, wild, changing?), preliminaries, practices, favorite positions, kinks differ. A couple mathematically cannot be 100% compatible, of course (and that's good, because it would be boring and completely unexciting). BUT some sexual compatibility has to be part of the equation. \nPeople should stop pursuing relationships with persons they are not sexually compatible with. They don't do that in the current society because the mediatic environment keeps brainwashing them with ideas about One True Love and how Love Can Change Anything, while carefully avoiding how complex harmony in a couple is, how the balance relies on many complicated aspect, and how sexual compatibility is one of them. \nIf one waits for marriage (for example), without having explored their personal sexual identity, they do not even know what they love the most, what they really don't like, if they are more about six times a days or one time a month, etc... It's calling for a lot of perplexity, hesitation, and frequently emotional suffering.\nPuritan ideologies teach us premarital hanky-panking systematically destroys the soul. I proclaim solemnly it is the opposite. Keeping yourself \"pure\" will only keep yourself ignorant of your own sexuality and extremely vulnerable to all kinds of manipulation and bad experiences.\n\nSo no, this story is not about how uncontrolled sex can destroy lives or something like that.\n\nI would like this to be crystal clear: THE [i][u]ALABASTER[/u][/i] CHARACTERS ARE NOT COMMITTING ANY KIND OF \"ERROR\" OR \"SIN\" WHEN THEY SLEEP WITH EACH OTHER.\nThey are simply having fun.\n\nAs long as you stay between consenting grown-ups and don't try any dangerous kind of intercourse like foreplay with guns or blades, I will never think badly of you.\n\nEven if your kink is doing it in a musclebeast fursuit or while quoting [i][u]Problem Sleuth[/u][/i].</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Please don't play katamari with the MSPA Fanadventure forum again :([/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\"> \n[ [i]This is referring to something that happened during the [LE] Intermission event.

But from your point of view, that's a vacation, yes. I talked about allowing myself a hiatus. Well, a hiatus is not happening, because I had this idea of a fake \"Scratched [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] Session\".\nSo you have some bonus content and something to read.\n\n2 - Sometimes, the choices I had when I began [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i], like \"trying to stay coherent with canon\", clash with the magnificently horrible ideas I have about parodying fandom. Amongst the things I really wanted to parody more, there is the bad understanding of canon. This stupid version of a Scratch, where the trolls are replaced with the lusus, is really relaxing. It allows me to be way stupider than usual, like you've noticed.\n\n3 - Sometimes, I really like to play with the support. Once again, my initial choices for [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i], which I won't change, stop me from entering into full delirium mode. But this Intermission is different.\n\n4 - We are heading towards the end of Chapter 3, my personal little Act 5. A bunch of drama bombs already unfolded in quick succession, especially if we look at Ginneo's side: he was hunted down by Goldie, then by his sprite, then by his goldified sprite, then he went through the Glitch and received a glitched death, then he was hunted down AGAIN by the Toy soldiers, then he was killed by the soldiers, then he wake up on Derse's moon and was hunted down agaaaaaain by the Underlings, and played a game of Asteroids with them, all of it while being tormented by hallucinations and headaches. And if we look at other details, we had the little puppy reaching Undog Tier, the Denizens waking up, the massacre of the Concomitants... It's like these days the story is only about adding more horror on more horror, and then there is a serious risk to desensibilise the reader entirely. We are talking about serious suspense and rhythm problems here. A story cannot be entirely about horrible things happening to characters, especially a 1000-panels-long story. In order to keep the horror efficient, I have to dose it wisely.\nSo a real recess was necessary. For tone and rhythm.\n\n5 - Another problem with the end of Chapter 3 is it cannot be too interactive. The village scene was especially linear, very different from my initial idea, but still seriously linear, unavoidably leading right to Ginneo's death, and to the awakening of his Dreamself. Once Dream Ginneo was awake, he had to reach his Land quickly... This precise moment where he dies, then tries to save himself while Vamuin and Batori sleep together, was planned almost since the beginning of the adventure, and since neither the previous events nor my imagination led me to better ideas, I had to do it this way. Linearity, linearity, linearity. All of this was linear, without any place for reader input, and... I had even more linearity approaching in the skyline! The end of chapter will be a dramatic chain of events. I was entirely satisfied with them, but it was linearity added to linearity with a beautiful icing of linearity. Reader input was almost reduced to zero. And... while this kind of storytelling is sometimes necessary in a very planned and structured adventure, here I had a way to give us a vacation. \n\n6 - Like some of you have already noticed, this Intermission has an intradiegetic existence. It is Ginneo's delirium. He didn't kiss himself in time, and his brain poisoned by vapors of old, putrefied sopor slime for years is now offering him a final hallucination. The narration is working on contrast here. Contrast between \"lolrandom\" humour and what you know to be Ginneo's reality. His agony. \n\n7 - The most important reason: I forgot to include the Territory of Main Twelve and Binoculars in Ginneo's Glitch moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nTooLongDidn'tRead:\n\n1 - I don't have time right now to do clean work, nice pics and to concentrate on narration. So INTERMISSION MAGIC!\n2 - Also I really wanted to use my stupid ideas parodying stupid fanworks!\n3 - I really like my metafuckery!\n4 - Too much drama, needed more jokes. If only because drama-only stories are sometimes boriiiing.\n5 - The story was going to lack too much interactivity!\n6 - Isn't it nice to think about how Gin is agonising this entire time?\n7 - TOMTAB is going to be the best part of [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] and it can't be forgotten!</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What Is Your Favorite Panel Of Homestuck And One Of Alabaster.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">\nKanaya, where are you finding time to read forum adventures?\n\n\nHOMESTUCK:\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/karkatcomputer.gif[/img]\nIt's a very simple panel, but I find Karkat's expression really touching here.

No more obnoxious than normal fancrap but that's not saying much in your favor. When did it stop being enough to simply admire something?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Don't you ever think that sending insulting questions is basically just wasting everyone's time and being downright rude?\n\nFanfiction is a very ancient thing. The concept as we know it appeared around the seventies, but since the dawn of mankind, people have used other people's ideas, characters and universes.\n\nIn the past, intellectual property and original creation were blurry concepts.\nFor example, in Ancient Greece, the tragedies were the result of huge competitions during the Dionysia festivals, and they were traditionally developed from a series of preexisting cycles: the Trojan War, Heracles' legend, Prometheus, the Argonauts... Tragedies are considered today as literary masterpieces and inevitable cultural references, but they were the most unoriginal thing at core, in modern terms, fanfiction competitions!\nClassical poetry is almost the same: it was using myths and stories everyone knew about.\nTolkien's universe recycled a lot of things from various legends, predominantly Norse mythology. Before him, Wagner was directly using the same mythology.\nEtc, etc. \n\nAt core, a fanwork is as artistically legitimate as an entirely original work. Inspiration is an integral part of creation. Maybe your only conscious artistic influence is your real life, but you need bricks to build a house.\n\n\"WHEN DID IT STOP BEING ENOUGH TO SIMPLY ADMIRE SOMETHING?\"\n\nSince... always?\n\nBecause some of us don't work that way. Some of us just need to draw what they want to draw, to write what they want to write, to make what they have the deep urge to make. And sometimes, we don't choose if it's fanwork or our own original creations which we need to do right now.\n\nYou are looking at the wole thing upside down: most fanworks are not done as an extra effort out of arrogance, but are the direct result of the simple urge to create something about the original work.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]It's rude to ask what plagues my mind every day? Why not make original things rather than basing it off an already successful work? To me it seems lazy, like cheating, not appreciative or flattering. Like a shortcut because you can't think of anything.\nI ask it not merely to you as who you are but you as a fan of MSPA that makes things. I can't understand the mentality behind it. Please, enlighten me. Personally I prefer to make things that stand on their own without taking someone elses ideas/format[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Allow your mind to be plagued by less trivial things. There are really more important matters than \"a bunch of people prefer to make fanfictions\".\n\nI thought it was obvious I can only speak for myself. I cannot enter into people's heads. I don't know for sure the most popular motivation for fanwork (then again, you already have the answer in your opinion: laziness and cheating).\n\nThere could be a lot of reasons to do a fanwork rather than an original work. OF COURSE an original work will always be more interesting. OF COURSE all the time and energy spent in a fanwork could find a better use in original art.\nBut that is not the point: sometimes, people just want to have fun, and sometimes, they have ideas so specifically related to a known universe they cannot use them in an original setting.\n\n\n\nP.S.: You may start to check each of your messages for The Infamous Last Sentence. After the strange \"When did it stop being enough to simply admire something?\", I'm afraid this time, your last line is jumping a very large herd of sharks.\n\"Personally I prefer to make things that stand on their own without taking someone elses ideas/format.\"\nLet's forget the fact you are apparently claiming to make things out of nothing, without any kind of exterior influence, I am very curious about how you manage to avoid any known format. Are you writing strange-shaped books with stone pages and colored and reversed fonts the reader can only understand by looking at a mirror? Do you make neopostmodernist two-seconds-long movies with an experimental camera recording thing at the microscopic scale? Do you have some kind of exclusive new animation technique performed with golems, that you use in fifteen-weeks-long spectacles?\nPlease notice we're still talking about known formats here.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Do you want an Ice cream ?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I'll only accept  legodong flavor.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Was SF a compilation of everything abhorrent about fanvillans/characters, much like the rest of Alabaster?

Aquatic fauna just isn't sexy enough.\"\n\n\n\n\nVamuin is (was?) of the highest shade possible without being a Deep One [b][purple blood: Gamzee's color][/b]. That's by this kind of detail you recognize a real munchkin/optimizator/Gary Stu.\nI don't remember if the words \"purple blood\" were directly indicated in any dialogue or narration, but his Concomitants share his blood color, the tongue and guts of his lusus are purple, his God Tier wings show both his fake typing color and his blood color, etc.\n\nPlus it was shown directly either by tears or by blood.\n\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed110.png[/img]\n\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed519.png[/img]\n\nIn the Tentacleking sequence, Vamuin both cried and bled (from his ripped wings), so you can check it out simply by [url=./Alabaster.html?p=1334]looking at the scene again[/url].\n\n\n\n\nVamuin types in \"Royal Blue\" for four main reasons.\n\n1 - It is a Karkat-like feature. As the leader of this spin-off team, it was only logical for Vamuin to assume at least one Karkat characteristic.\nBut since Vamuin is the Anti-Karkat (an ineffective, irresponsible leader, always relaxed, a solar figure, admired by a lot of people, not caring about romance, assuming a dynamic role and really putting the entire session in motion himself), the reason why he doesn't type in his true blood colour is the opposite to Karkat's: rather than fear and shame, it is pride and arrogance.\n\n2 - Vamuin loves fashion. It's his hipster side. By Alternian standards, Vamuin is not only a little bimbo: he's the queen of bimbos. It's just so original to type in a different color, you know? Really shows how different you are.\nPlus it makes him more mundane... No Surfer Asshole will ever be taken alive looking like some old nobility. \n\n3 - Extradiegetically, for a troll living by the sea, there is some aesthetic to this shade of blue.\n\n4 - Still extradiegetically, there is a little joke behind it. What we know currently as the \"Royal Blue\" is only the Internet-era Royal Blue. [url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/color-indigo.htm]The traditional Royal Blue[/url] is... a shade of purple/indigo.\n</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]It kind of feels like the Denizens are a bit too powerful. Like I don't think even Lord English could accomplish redirecting a special ability from the Session to Alternia without using any defense portals. Does this tie into the 'Earthbound rip' thing?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Firstly, both teleportation and communication between the session and an universe are way more common than you seem to think. It is true the meteors going through the defense portals are the main way to send directly objects, game constructs and living beings to the parent universe, but there are Appearifiers, Sendificators, Exile screens, Ectobiology machines...\n\nSecondly, we don't know the details of the way the \"Twisted Hand\" power works.\nIt may be not directly targeted to the Player, but to their Dream Self, and then the power is redirected right through them.\nBecause the strongest link, both physically and communication-wise, between a session and the parent universe is definitely Dream Selves. They can inherit the wounds of the Player (physical link) and they share their consciousness (mental link).\n\nThirdly, no, [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i]'s Denizens are not insanely powerful. They are approximately at the level of raw power of a God Tier Player... maybe slightly lower (if only because they can die anytime, not only from \"Just\" or \"Heroic\" death.\nThe main challenge coming from these Denizens isn't their level of power, but rather the fact all of them are precisely calibrated to counter and to eliminate their respective Player.\nThey can be defeated. Maybe they will? Do you believe in magic?</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I'll be honest, you're not really selling me on these guys being the 'most selfish, arrogant and depraved trolls in all paradox space'. Like so far, I'm pretty sure Eridan has them outclassed on being despicable, and he was only 6 sweeps old.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The opening description of [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] is mainly a \"slogan\", to indicate the tone and purposes of the adventure right at the beginning.\n\nBut I can understand how you think you've been tricked by dishonest advertising.\n\nBecause at core... You are right.\n\n\n\nThere are certainly a LOT of more despicable trolls, since post-Scratch Alternia is a culture of violence and hatred. Yeah, I admit it, the advertising was dishonest.\nSee, I was tricked by the fact you can't tell a story without showing at least a little love, respect and interest for the characters. Or at least *I* can't tell a story without these things. Deep down, I'm a little Carebear, and more pragmatically, we need to be attached to the characters in order to care for them. It is even more important in the case of a horror story: if we don't like the cast, we won't be horrified!\n\n\n\nOn another hand, Vamuin is clearly selfish, arrogant and depraved. You can't tell me he isn't. You can't tell me most of the cast is healthy, too.\nThe description wasn't saying anything about how \"despicable\" the characters were going to be. One's feelings towards Team Alabaster is a matter between themselve and the characters. You're free to like, to love or to hate Vamuin, Ginneo, Batori, Renart, Crossover, Sectra and all of the secondary cast. You can even feel like a frightening scene is in fact laughable, or a comical scene is sinister. I won't tell you what is right or wrong to feel. \nEven if the way the text is phrased led you to think the cast is despicable (and these connotations are certainly there), if we look at the thing literally, the description is only establishing the characters are extremely selfish, arrogant and depraved.\nAnd they are.\n\nPlus this is a story containing Ophiuchus the Great.\n\nOphiuchus the Great.\n\nThink about it.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Is Seigneur Français the Lord English of Alabaster, or is he just a one-shot joke villain with no plot relevance?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">\"One-shot joke villain with no plot relevance\". That's a very good definition for Seigneur Français.\n\nA previous question asked \"[i]Is SF a compilation of everything abhorrent about fanvillains/characters, much like the rest of Alabaster?[/i]\". And that was another very good definition.\n\nSeigneur Français is based on Lord English as the fandom imagined him before we knew he was going to be Green Skeletor. Back then, most of the fans were visualizing him as some kind of tall and mysterious bishonen. \n\nHe's not coming back, at least not in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i], and not in any of my fictions.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Also, what do you think would Karkat would say if he met Ophiuchus the Great?

The only Gilgameshs I know and can remember right now are the Sumerian one and the [u][i]Final Fantasy[/i][/u] one, and they don't look anything like Vamuin for sure!\n\n\n\n\nBut here are some of my inspirations for Vamuin.\n\n\n\n\nTONY STONEM\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/tony.png[/img]\nNarcissistic, power-starving, controlling, polysexual and a complete sociopath, Tony is the antihero leading the first generation of characters in the British TV series [u][i]Skins[/i][/u]. Extremely intelligent, seductive and sociable, but lacking any kind of moral values, he exhales a strange kind of purity. He is a dark angel, a luciferian figure.\nTony was my main influence for Vamuin's manipulative and attractive side.\n\n\n\nJAMES COOK\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/cook.png[/img]\nCook is the main character of the second generation of [u][i]Skins[/i][/u]. More mundane in his intelligence than Tony, he is often seen as a more extreme, grotesque, and kinda gross version of his predecessor. Cook is frontal, brutal, he is all about fucking everyone in corridors, about eating and drinking like a pig, the most dirty and repulsive things regularly happen to him, he is more directly linked to the devil. He hasn't any subtlety.\nCook was clearly my main influence for Vamuin's overall \"whatever\" attitude. \n\n\n\nTIDUS\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/tidus.png[/img]\nThe hero in the video game [u][i]Final Fantasy X[/i][/u]. I didn't like the game a lot, in fact I hated it, and mostly because of his \"Californian surfer\" main character.\nTidus was a secondary influence for Vamuin's looks.\n\n\n\nTHOR\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/thor.png[/img]\nNot the God, the character in the magnificent movie [u][i]Kaboom[/i][/u]. He basically IS Vamuin, both physically and mentally. No need to describe it, [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0sgcLlL_WE]just look at this video[/url].</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What terrible aspect of the fandom do Mnevia, Weywot, and Ophiuchus The Great represent?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Three of Vamuin's quadrants, Mnevia, Weywot and Hemsut, are \"serious trolls\".\nIt's the kind of equilibrate character you find everywhere in the fandom, particularly in the Trollslum threads where a lot of people are attentive to have a troll who isn't a munchkin, or an angsty sociopath, or a sex god, etc.\nThey don't have overpowered psionic powers.\nThey aren't crazy.\nThey understand quadrants the normal way, they are not cheating on everyone with everything like Vamuin or sleeping with their lusus like Ginneo.\nThey are dressed in simple black and grey clothes (okay, plus Via's brown nylon catsuit) because canonically, trolls have almost no interest in fashion.\nTo put it shortly, they are a link to the mythic \"canon conception of an Alternian troll\" (mythic because none of the Main Twelve answers to the definition). They are doing what most of the main characters, and particularly the three first Players, cannot do: they look normal.\n\nThey aren't \"terrible\", they aren't a parody. They are part of the serious aspect of [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]. This is not a mere satire of the fandom. This is also meant to be a good, coherent [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] spin-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOphiuchus the Great is the reverse. He's a concentration of wrongness. Most of [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] characters are only showing one wrong aspect. But everything in Ophiuchus is meant to be terrible. Let's start the count, shall we?\n\n\n\n\n~ APPEARANCE ~\n\nIMPOSSIBLE HORNS\nVery common, and almost not in need of any explanation. But since some of you are probably innocent readers, blessed with ignorance about the eldritch depths of our beloved fandom, let's establish many fans think the bigger the horns are, the better their troll design is. I saw trolls with six horns, I saw trolls with a forest of horns, I even saw a troll whose right arm was a horn.\nAnd for the recent recolor: blue is the most common fantroll horn color in the fandom, when they decide candycorn isn't good enough for them. Probably because it's the opposite color. Does collective subconscious know color theory?\n\nCYAN EYES\nI saw it. Really.\n\nBLUE HAIR AND BEARD\nI once saw in an early Trollslum thread a bald troll with black eyes and a blue beard. Say no more. The beard needed to be there. The hair clearly needed to be a different blue, too.\n\nGREEN TEETH\nOnce again, I saw it in an old Trollslum, with no explanation, on some hipster character who also had nearly unreadable clothes motif and luminous glasses. I also took the clothes motif, but left the glasses out of the equation. Some things are better left to imagination.\n\nPLAID CLOTHES\nYep, like I said, I also took the nearly unreadable clothes motif. But I changed colors, the original ones weren't ugly enough.\n\nRED-SPIRAL-ON-BLACK-BACKGROUND CLOTHES\nFor mysterious reasons (probably only \"it's fashionable\"), a lot of fantrolls take their inspirations in Tim Burton's style. So, spirals, and a Mad Hatter-like tophat with some kind of printed circuit board as a card.\n\nSTEAMPUNK\nA lot of fantrolls are also steampunk, which seems really strange to me when we look at the Twelvies' clothes, or even to their Ancestors'. It doesn't really add up with anything we know about Alternia, to be frank. So I thought about the horns/casters/toy key system I talk about in a previous answer.\nIt also goes well with the Burtonesque tophat.\nI completed the steampunk-like aspect with a strange monocular which can be locked to binoculars or to a sniper rifle power scope (to make it both more baroque and absurd).\n\n\n\n\n~ PERSONALITY ~\n\n\nLiteral Shipping. Literal bloodswap. Literal genderbending (we're not going to see this one, thank you very much). Development of completely divergent \"headcanons\", to the point the Main Twelves as Ophiuchus envisions them have almost have no relation left to the real ones. Impossible hacking abilities. Wrong analysis of basically everything that is going on. Disturbing roleplay. Supposedly daylight resistance.

Vamuin was mainly meant to be what I said he was supposed to be, a \"dude\" version of some ancient demigod, gathering Apollonian and Dionysian concepts in a superficial and crude shape. An antihero to set the story in motion.\n\nBut now that you talk about it, I see the similarities with Vriska, of course. The sheer egocentrism, the need for challenge, the exclusion of any clues relating to a possible defeat.

He wore humble clothes, and even the sash displaying his role was his poor and unpretentious creation. He disliked higher powers, so he made a point of directing the team while listening to all of their advice.\nTogether, they created this world of peace and life before departing for another star. And because the leader listened to his team, he accepted it when the Main Twelve decided to appoint a powerful king to reign on the Territory, despite his personal hatred of such monarchs.\nHe would have he been saddened to know that King Tom, after their departure, soon died from a poisoned can of diet soda. He became simply a puppet in Derse's hand, and so he doomed the entire Land.\n\nConcomitants: Blue kitties. You can see them in [url=./Alabaster.html?p=1094]one of the [LE] panels[/url], they are made from Nepeta's hood.\n\nLieutenants: Giants snakes. Usually found wrapped around tubular temples, they reproduce a caduceus, in reference to Ophiuchus.\n\nApocryptid Resident: Marionette. After his death, Tom became a LITERAL puppet. His cadaver was cut in pieces then re-articulated. To vanquish Marionette, one must not hit the body, but the Control Bar, a sentient Dersite artifact situated above the creature.\nBonus sketch:\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/marionette.png[/img]</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What kind of powers do you get when you achive Un-Dog Tier?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The Un-Dog Tier is a glitch based on reversed First Guardian/God Tier Jade.

I think you've noticed when we start approaching the canon of Homestuck, the levels of narration and metanarration become fuzzy.\n\nNo matter the origin of the glitch, most of the Un-Dog Tier's aspects are just the reverse (or the absurd translations) of Dog Tier Jade's.\nJade has dog-like features =/= Almost any kind of feature recalling a dog's shape are erased.\nJade can teleport everywhere in the session =/= He can't move anywhere.\nJade can only die a \"heroic\" or \"just\" death =/= The Un-Dog Tier can't die until the Incipisphere dies a \"heroic\" or \"just\" death.\nJade is gifted with many powerful aptitudes =/= He is completely powerless.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I'm almost afraid to ask, but who or what the hell did you base Ginneo off of?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">He's the most \"independent\" of the current characters. He is heavily based on furry fetishes, but if you look at character inspirations, all of this is quite subtle.\n\nThere is of course all of the canon inspirations. Ginneo is way more directly based on [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] characters than Vamuin. The main idea was an inoffensive/clueless/cute one, the lovechild of Tavros and Nepeta, but he has Equius' nightmarish furry side, and of course, also a lot in common with Gamzee.\n\nBut the main reference for the character, in lack of luck and symbolism, is [url=https://www.google.com/search?q=calimero]Calimero[/url].\n\nPast Ginneo is mainly a masheup of metalhead, military otaku and various badass archetypes, and is meant to be the opposite of Ginneo: a \"perfect troll\" training for army and not knowing anything about friendship.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I wait update for too long.

Yes?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Nope, sorry! You're close to the general idea of the work, though.\n\nThe only thing is, you're interpreting the characters a little *too* metaphorically. There aren't a lot of symbols related to the \"fandom parody\" aspect: just like the fetishes I sometimes illustrate here, I prefer to simply take the ideas and to play them straight. So straight they become particular characters and horror material.\nFor example, bloodswap isn't really criticized: it is just done literally, with unwilling blood transfusions. I think this kind of horrible mess expresses more of my feelings about this kind of concept than a thousand lines.\n\nRenart is a satire/parody of many things, but his \"Circular Hemospectrum\" delirium refers to nothing else than... Circular Hemospectrum delirium.\nYes, there are [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i] readers who truly believe Hemospectrum is circular.

Was that design a conscious choice on your part, or just a coincidence?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Yes, it is Crossover, criticalOutlander [CO] by her trolltag. And yes, she is dressed as a Red Mage.\n\nIt was a conscious choice on my part, and also originally the result of sheer randomness. Let's go back in time to explain it with the amount of detail no one will ever need!\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST PART: THE RANDOM2.PNG FILE\n\n\nWhen I started [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u], I wanted to stay as close as possible to Hussie's style by many aspects. I wanted to develop the story around ridiculous jokes, to make raw speed my main priority, to enhance the experience for both the readers and me in many experimental and interactive ways. I wanted the environments and characters in \"Hussiesprite Mode\" to contain perspective errors and recycled, \"serigraphied\" photographies. I wanted the trolls to really troll each other in their pesterlogs, and I wanted them to embody fandoms and archetypes. Etc.\n\nBut I also wanted to do something different. I wanted to try a large palette of visual styles, and to give all the main characters their personal representation Mode. I didn't want to make every panel an animated .gif, for various reasons (it takes too much time, it isn't sober enough to my taste, it doesn't goes well with a horror story, etc). Etc.\nAmongst my objectives, I wanted to avoid many stylization aspects, such as the total absence of extras. Did you notice in [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] we never see ANYONE, alive or dead, who isn't a character relevant to the story? The closest thing we have to extras is some sketches of random troll silhouettes manipulated by Vriska or busy hanging Redglare. We never see Alternia's frightening fauna, too. Undeads, musclebeasts and various monsters are left in the shadows.\nThe absence of Extras is a very interesting choice, both narratively and visually, but like I said, I thought there were some interesting things to do about it.\nSo I answered some canon questions which, to be fair, do not need any answer in [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u], but are still funny to answer to, such as:\n- What does a musclebeast look like?\n- What is the traditional folklore surrounding Rainbow Drinkers?\n- Who ensures the wrigglers are facing the deadly trials, if all adult trolls are in space?\n- How was the apocalypse perceived by trollkind?\n\nWow, I sure got carried away, right? I only wanted to explain why it was interesting to me to add Extras. That's how Tozy, Via and other characters were created. Because in the canon story, there doesn't appear to be ANY troll related to the Main Twelves, except the Main Twelve themselves. That's stylization. Of course the Main Twelve have online and real life friends. Just like the Kids do. Do you really think John Egbert ONLY speaks to Dave, Rose and Jade ever?\nSo I created Extras. I kept it a little stylized by directly linking most of them to Vamuin, because a story cannot work without a little stylization (an unstylized story would be a story where you follow the main character everywhere, when they go to the bathroom, when they take their breakfast, when they get bored in the subway, when they sleep, without any timeskip... No one wants that). But I created Extras.\nQuickly enough, these Extras became Supporting Roles. I left them to evolve this way. So Tozy, Via, Copycat became more important characters, while clearly not being the Players.\nAnd then, I created Real Extras. Characters fated to appear in only one scene. Generally a party. The parties you see by the beginning of the story in various flashbacks are a way to suggest there are many trolls outside the main story.\n\nHere, see the kind of picture I'm talking about:\n\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed174.png[/img]\n\nThe parties also serve to foreshadow or to reinforce various Players to come or Supporting Roles.\nIn this one, you can notice Crossover. Except this isn't true foreshadowing. It is retroactive foreshadowing, because I finally turned her into a real character, but back then, she wasn't supposed to be. Like the majority of the sprites here, she was a Real Extra. I didn't even save most of these sprites in my computer. I worked on them directly in the picture, then I turned the picture directly into two panels, a normal-sized frame and a zoom-out. \nCrossover was a leftover, one of two or three sprites I randomly kept, just to have some visual coherence if I needed to do yet another party. She didn't even have a name. She was [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/sprites/random2.png]random2.png[/url] in a secondary folder between the preparation work for \"[S] Ophiuchus: Got Tiger\" and \"[I ] Wey: Wash your hair\".\nShe was indeed a very random sprite, just a recolored Boy-Skylark with a reversed Pac-Man as a symbol. Like most of these Real Extras, she was also hastily drawn and the color scheme was not the clearest thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECOND PART: THE FIFTH PLAYER\n\n\nLast summer, I started thinking seriously about the Fifth Player. And I finally decided to use Crossover.\n\nThis very particular character, more colored than most (and breaking the RUMP code, like a reader named Matrix noticed), was a fuzzy idea. But I quickly decided fourth things about her:\n- Female (three boys, three girls for the main characters)\n- An absolute jackass to everyone (for some peppered trolling)\n- A tabletop roleplayer (let's be meta)\n- Related to other universes \nThen I started to talk about her with Flabber Ghast (the person who wrote a lot of Ginneo's lines, created the big lines of Ophiuchus' personality out of nowhere in the first UU pesterlog, and also one of the friends responsible for making this story even more horrible).\n\nAnd Flabber noticed the random2.png looked like a Red Mage disguise.\n\nSo when I revamped the sprite, I turned the clothes into a regular Red Mage costume.\nI also changed the symbol to the [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/crosstheus.png]Cross of Theus[/url] (another idea from Flabber Ghast, taken from the 7th Sea tabletop roleplaying game), I made the colors easier to read, the shapes nicer, and I added freckles and elvish ears. \n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/sprites/crossoverevolution.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIRD PART: WHY THE HELL DID YOU CHOOSE A RED MAGE?\n\n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/ff3redmage.png[/img]\n\n[url=http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Mage]Red Mages[/url] appeared [i]very[/i] early in the [u][i]Final Fantasy[/i][/u] series, in [u][i]Final Fantasy 1[/i][/u]. From the beginning, they were a versatile Job class, able to cast opposite magics (Black and White) AND to wear strong armor (mages typically cannot wear armor). Additionally, in most games of the series, they can cast two magics in one turn and to buff their magical abilities. \nSo basically, a Red Mage is an one-man army, who can heal himself and damage the enemy simultaneously, while receiving less damage than usual mages, and some of them can even boost their stats in the process! Such is the glory of a true gamebreaking class.\n\nThis is the kind of class some experienced roleplayers will choose, especially when they have a lonesome personality (Crossover cares for people, but she isn't very sociable) and want to be able to face any kind of situation themselves.\n\nBut this is also the class of one of the best webcomic characters, [url=http://8bittheater.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Mage_Statscowski]Red Mage Statscowski[/url].

Renart is loosely linked to Abenaki mythology. \"Azeban\", for example, is a raccoon trickster spirit in Abenaki mythology.\n\nP.P.S.: I specifically choose the \"Hollowed Abenaki Sun\" symbol for its resemblance to the SBURB Time symbol. Added to Renart's blood color, the comparison was just unavoidable.

So I had the Un-Dog Tier idea.\n\nIn [url=./Alabaster.html?p=822]the first page of the transformation[/url], you can see the background is actually part of the 10:25 Cascade Flash movie, reversed in both color and screen orientation. The \"risky circumstances\" the text is referring to are not only the Glitch affecting the characters, but also the precise moment of the Scratch.\nParadox Space is strongly linked to the concept of \"accidental simultaneity\", both [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&p=005717]intradiegetically[/url] and extradiegetically.\nSo both in-story and to a more meta level, the simultaneity of the fanon Glitch and canon Scratch allowed this uncommon bug to happen.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]why didnt the puppy get un-marsupial tier? or even un-tiger-dog tier?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Because at core, the Un-Dog Tier has nothing to do with his marsupial nature.

And Vamuin deactivated the option for everyone except Sectra.\n\nBut sure, if Vamuin had a real Ancestor, he would look like Jecht.\n\nAbout Ophiuchus, if we suppose he IS part of the SGRUBrip session and we consider Ancestors are more mature and extreme versions of the characters with *bigger* horns...

And then they also wonder why the town in [u][i]Silent Hill: Shattered Memories[/i][/u] doesn't look anything like the town of the previous games.\nThe thing they amazingly fail to get is these are DIFFERENT canons. The official puritan religion of the [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] movie is deliberately the reverse of the secret pseudo-satanist cult of the [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] games. The plot of [u][i]Shattered Memories would make no sense in the usual [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] canon.\nWe are talking about three different universe with different rules here, thank you very much, so stop saying Gans \"didn't understand [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u]\".\nGans understood it more than a large part of the fandom, and he even spotted some elements which most players never grasped, like the concentration camps influence. [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] never talks about the World War II, and its thematics have nothing to do with it, but visually, it is a major influence, maybe the most important one. The entire movie is built around video games mechanisms, contains real video game riddles (and there's even one where you lose the item allowing you to solve the riddle, the Knife, once it's solved... Knife which is also a callback to [u][i]Silent Hill 2[/i][/u]'s unusable Knife), video game symbols, loads of references to the general video game universe, hundred of references to the survival horror genre, THOUSAND of references to the [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] franchise. Entire sequences (particularly the first Nightmare sequence) use the storyboard of the games. Almost all story elements are from the games. Most monsters are from the game. It uses latex effects and dancers for the bestiary in order to convey a more organic feeling than simple CGI. It uses crappy video effects for the flashback. You have the radio effect and the flashlight, the most important parts of the [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] identity in the first game. You have mannequins in the old stores. Every location, store is named after those of the games.\nOkay, for sure, it didn't have the games' subtlety. For sure, it changed the mechanics of the Underworld, and had a different plot. But I've never seen a fanwork which conveyed so much love for the original game. \nThe actors are good and serious. The photography is detailed and beautiful. The editing is simple, efficient. The entire soundtrack is done by the composer of all the [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u] games, Akira Yamaoka. And the story manages to have rhythm without turning into a stupid actioner like the [u][i]Resident Evil[/i][/u] movies.\n\nI could talk about this movie for hours. But let's stop here.\nChristophe Gans, I love your [u][i]Silent Hill[/i][/u].

For various reasons. Mainly to have a better rhythm and more fluid storytelling.\n\nBut generally, when it comes to \"proceed in regard to new canon information\", I don't *have* to do it. Usually, the new canon information has nothing to do with the events and characters of my story. [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i] isn't a prequel or a sequel (which would both be very dangerous things to do when one tries to stay coherent with canon, especially considering [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i] isn't even finished), it is a spin-off telling the story of another session, a hacked SGRUB session with modified rules. Frankly, I'm in such a dead zone, background-wise...\n\nI don't consider my plans could be destroyed by canon events, only enriched. I integrate new [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i] data as it comes because it's usually refreshing and stimulating to me.\n\nI already talked about my attitude regarding this matter in an old Formspring answer.\n\n\n\nOf course, there is also the question of minor retcons in already existing pages. That may be what you had in mind when you asked your question.\n\nI'm not opposed to minor retcons. In fact, occasionally, I modify a minor detail in text or panels for consistency or elegance purposes. That's correction, not revision.\nI usually forbid myself to add any foreshadowing (and if I ever do, I'll indicate it in the thread), because foreshadowing by retcon is a very clumsy and mediocre way to tell a story in my opinion.\n\nThe only significant retcon I ever did regarding canon is on [url=./Alabaster.html?p=141]this page[/url].\nThe original text talked about how Ginneo and Goldie were going to split ways when Ginneo will become an adult.\nSince, Hussie has canonically indicated the troll-lusus association lasts for life, it only evolves into a mature relationship, the troll and the lusus working together, like Redglare and Pyralspite. \nI slightly corrected this page to talk about how their relationship \"is not going to turn into mature association\". </FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What would you do if you met Ophiuchus the Great?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Luckily enough, I can run pretty fast.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How do you think Hivebent would have different if Ophiuchus actually was the leader of the Main Twelve?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">That is... not a good question at all.\n\nIt would have involved a lot of literal bloodswap and Gamzee would have to do sloppy makeouts with Sollux because clearly they love each other and ohGodit'stimetostoptalkingaboutthis.\n\nJust look at every smut or non-smut fanfic mistaking horribly everything going on in [i][u]Homestuck[/u][/i], or shoehorning headcanon,  etc. \n\nThen think to ALL these things simultaneously and forcibly applied to Karkat and his friends.\n\n\n\nAct 5.1 did enough damage to the collective psyche as it was, thank you.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I'm not Ed and I'm asking questions.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Well, that's reassuring.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]I'm not Ed either[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Oh, great.\n\nWait...

I'd like to date it more precisely, but my computer is being stupid and when I check the data of the program, it loads the profile and date of... the newer Paint, the one who comes with Vista, which still is on this computer.\n\nI use the newer Paint and screencaps of Windows Image Viewer when I want to reduce pictures without completely destroying the sprites (I don't know if you have noticed, but Paint really doesn't reduce pixel art well), I use Photoshop and Gimp when I have to add a special filter (for example, the flashback effet), to work on texture and to prepare serigraphied photos.\n\nBut I use the old Paint most of the time. Mainly, when you don't have a nice fantasy static effect in the panel, or color gradients or anything like that, there is a good chance it is made with Paint and only Paint. \n\nSome recent examples of Paint-only panels:\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed1175.png[/img]\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed1217.png[/img]\n[img]./assets/img/story/doomed1258.png[/img]\n\nI know how to make pictures with more sophisticated programs. Using mainly Paint, and using Paint-only Modes for the main characters, is an artistic choice both to have a try at a real \"MS Paint Adventure\" and to ameliorate my skills with an unreasonable challenge.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]will we get exposition on the other military leaders on gin's planet or are they so long dead or not important enough to be a moot point?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Are we even sure the \"other military leaders\" ever existed to begin with?\n\nIt is game background at core. I don't think the history of the Lands really happened in canon. Maybe it does, but I feel a distinct ringtone of falseness to the babble John Egbert's Consorts are delivering, for example. Skaia doesn't need the \"past events\" leading to the current state of all the Lands to have ever been real. Therefore, it would be a waste of energy (or of mystical process, or of midi-chlorians, choose your own resource) to produce them.\n\nMy personal interpretation, and the one I'm using in [i][u]Alabaster[/u][/i], is if you come at a Land before the corresponding Player enters, you just find a pale shadow of the Land. It may be frozen, or even some kind of mystical wireframe (a wireframe made of SBURB spirographs?). These planets are only there as a theatre of trials, tailored both from the Player's soul and from their mythological role. They don't need a past.\n\nI probably won't explain it in-story (since I think the readers have the right to interpret things differently, here), but every time the Consorts talk about the past of the Land, it is empty background in my opinion.\nI don't think Patriarcha was ever something else than [url=./Alabaster.html?p=1170]the giant distorted Archaeopteryx with the Squid within him[/url]. He probably BELIEVED he once was the righteous king of the birds, the wise and mighty Kapellmeister. But he was always a monster and the main boss of the Land.\nSimilarly, there are pretty good chances the great war in the Territory of Belligerence and Glaciation never was.\n\nSo I'm afraid the \"other military leaders\" Ginneo's Consorts keep talking about only exist in their memories.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]do the progeny have 1 eyes or 2?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">All Progenies only have one eye, without eyelid, iris or pupil.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Why don't you make the French adventure.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">While I love my country, its history, its culture, its geography, I also live in here. So it's a LOT less exotic and interesting to me than it could be to American eyes.\n\nPlus I almost never write fiction set in the real world. I like to see how different things could be, not how [color=#045FB4]aweso°me[/color] it would be to see some random story about burglars or whatever. It just doesn't provide me the amount of poetry and creativity I need. I wouldn't say real world stories aren't poetic or creative. I say personally, when I try to write them (more like \"if I tried to write them\"), it doesn't inspire me, and I don't find these ingredients there.\n\nAnd lastly, at core, nationality is just as useless to my identity as gender. I don't need it to know who I am. I sometimes play with \"Frenchness\" as a hobby, because it is always fun to strangers, apparently. An adventure is more investment, too much to build it around so limited gag material.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler] \n\n\n\n\n[left][u]what are crossovers chances of actually making it into the game?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Well, if we look at the story until now...\n\nVamuin: No trouble entering\nGinneo: Trouble entering\nBatori: Death WHILE entering\n\n... you can see some kind of pessimistic progression.\n\n\n\n\nOn another hand, surely I won't kill all of the remaining characters before they enter.\n\nSurely.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How has Ophiuchus the Great not been killed by his own stupidity, a vengeful Troll who managed to escape his grasp and returned to exact revenge, or a rampaging musclebeast?

It would take a lot of time, because there are so many traps she would need to deactivate.\n\nAnd it wouldn't change anything, since the alpha timeline is already doomed to fail and so she would merely create a new doomed timeline.

I finished most of them multiple times. Also searched for every information source possible about these games.\n(I didn't try the official text adventures, phone games and the Arcade because they have a worse reputation than [i][u]Homecoming[/u][/i] and are, by all the data I obtained, more \"un-canon\" than the lowest James X Walter fanfic. Lord, give me the strength to stay pure!)\n\n\n\nLike the [i][u]Silent Hill[/u][/i] movie, I could speak about these games for hours, so I'll try to keep things short and simple.\n\n\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill[/u][/i]\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/silenthill1.png[/img]\nAn astounding experience, at lot more generous gameplay-wise than the PS1 [i][u]Resident Evil[/u][/i] games, with a general guess-the-plot-yourself attitude which gives it an evocative, deep and powerful atmosphere.\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill 2[/u][/i]\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/silenthill2.png[/img]\nLess \"classic horror\" than the first opus, without real boss, obvious monsters or a \"real-world plot\" about conspiracies, this is less of an adventure and more of a dive into the insane depths of a mind. It is a very courageous game, unlike any other.\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill 3[/u][/i]\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/silenthill3.png[/img]\nWe go back to the \"main storyline\". More action-paced, impressive, dynamic, violent... but the game still doesn't forget to be subtle, full of ideas, and emotionally crushing. It was my favorite episode for a very long time.\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill 4: The Room[/u][/i]\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/silenthill4.png[/img]\nWell, it is... interesting. I found the illogical and mystical aspect of the supernatural too obvious in this episode, to the point it stops being disturbing, but like usual, many good ideas.\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill: Origins[/u][/i]\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/silenthillorigins.png[/img]\nExtremely impressive if you take into account the game was made for a portable console. Like the movie, it highlights aspects of [i][u]Silent Hill 1[/u][/i] most of the fandom tends to forget, and it also gives an interesting variation of the James-Pyramid Head relationship. Too bad that it's also not a very original plot, and it's interlaced with the \"main storyline\" (mixing the two materials doesn't make any sense). But it's not bad.\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill: Homecoming[/u][/i]\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/homecoming.png[/img]\nI liked some aspects of it, like the very Stephen King atmosphere (going back to the roots of the series) or the combat system (the gameplay should adapt to the main character, and here it's doing so) or the WAIT DON'T BOTHER IT'S A CRAPPY AND HORRIBLE GAME AND IT COMPLETELY DESTROYS ITS SUPPOSED CANON ON SO MANY LEVELS IT'S SO BAD AVOID AT ANY COST.\n\n\n\n[i][u]Silent Hill: Shattered Memories[/u][/i] \n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/shattered.png[/img]\nA homage, a beautiful synthesis of everything [i][u]Silent Hill[/u][/i] is about and a masterpiece in its own right, an extremely mature horror story (it is rare to see horror this mature, this touching... it is a story about human beings, not about monsters), the return of a feeling of mystery (thank you independent canon!), a quite efficient game with a courageous gameplay, a stunning art direction, and finally the tears, the delicious sadness.\nMy favorite episode, I think, deep down. I don't care if \"it isn't done by the original team\". It looks more like my ideal [i][u]Silent Hill[/u][/i] than [i][u]The Room[/u][/i], for example, and it is the kind of intelligent variation the following games should look for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome may have noticed I didn't mention the music yet.\nWell, if you don't know the series, it should be mentioned ALL of the [i][u]Silent Hill[/u][/i] games are blessed with magnificent, gorgeous, palatial soundtracks by Akira Yamaoka.\nJust try [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SBY_fUpmnQ]Letter From The Lost Days[/url], for example.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]You should submit some of your characters to fantroll review blogs just to see their reactions.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">I...

It seems more interested in sexually assaulting the other grotesque monsters of [i][u]Silent Hill[/u][/i] than attacking you. At least, initially.\n\nWho/what Red Pyramid is exactly depends of the canon.\n\nPersonally, I find the only interesting incarnations to be [i][u]Silent Hill 2[/u][/i]'s and the movie's. Both have real significance, the absence of both would harm the plot deeply, they have opposite physical characteristics, and both have extremely disturbing implications, the first one psychologically, the second one religiously, both psychoanalytically.\n\nOtherwise, Red Pyramid has been (and becomes more and more) of a cameo, a random boogeyman, Slenderman with a helmet. Not so interesting.\n\nI could talk about Pyramid Head for hours, and the vocation of this Formspring isn't to provide extensive spoilers on another work, unless you're specifically asking for them.\n\nSo I'll just give you two links:\n[url=http://silenthill.wikia.com/wiki/Pyramid_Head]Complete exposition[/url] [color=#FF0000](spoilers!)[/color]\n[url=http://www.articlesbase.com/computer-games-articles/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-analysis-1932719.html][i][u]Silent Hill 2[/u][/i]'s Red Pyramid[/url]  [color=#FF0000](more spoilers!)[/color]</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]i think silent hive broke, it isnt working anymore for me[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Well, for once it's the game which is broken and not another gamer mind.\n\nWorks fine for me.

You may even be mislead about what the word \"parody\" originally means...\n\n\n\n\nABOUT PARODY\n\n\nYou are using an extremely limited definition of \"parody\".\n\nParody doesn't have to be entirely, or even mainly, about light humour. There are countless works of satire and dark, grinning humour which are (deliberately) more sinister than amusing. For example, the theatre play [u][i]Le Père Noël est une ordure[/i][/u] ([u][i]Santa Claus is a bastard[/i][/u]... if you want to have an idea of the plot, you can look for the movie adaptation with the same title, or the awful, awful, and awfully censored, American remake, [u][i]Mixed Nuts[/i][/u]) is a parody of a happy Christmas tale. It is a horrible story about a bunch of depressed and miserable people trying to get better together, failing amazingly, shooting people by accident, butchering them to hide the body, and finally dying when one of the most suicidal and lonely members of the cast, repeatingly failing to get in touch with the other characters, kills himself by making the entire building explode.\nFunny, right?\n\nEven if you're understanding the word \"parody\" only in the \"comedy\" sense, you're wrong if you think it means only looking at light things. Sometimes, comedy isn't just about making things ridiculous. Comedy is tragedy at core; or maybe more accurately, tragedy is comedy gold. Think about some comedies. The archetypal Charlie Chaplin character is the most unlucky man. In [u][i]Home Alone[/i][/u] or [u][i]Dennis the Menace[/i][/u], we're looking at people getting mauled by the little boy until they are completely humiliated and desperate. Etc. There are many reasons for horrible things to be comical, the first one being, I think, it *relieves* us. While it's happening to other people, it is not happening to us! And finally our life isn't so horrible, yep? Look at poor Chaplin!\n\nParody and comedy both can be many interesting things. A comedy can be a magnificent story in its own right: think about [u][i]Groundhog Day[/i][/u]! Generally (at least in my book), you can recognize a good comedy by the fact it is still good even if you mentally remove the humour. A good comedy has characters, situations, thematics and details. A good comedy has ideas, creativity, generosity. And a good comedy doesn't have to be only a light story wanting to get some laughs. Mel Brooks' [u][i]Young Frankenstein[/i][/u] is a simple example. A lot of people don't like it because it is a black-and-white movie (at a time when color was already the norm) and it has a quite sad, deep, nostalgic atmosphere. It isn't so funny. But it is a beautiful movie, and a love declaration to all of the old Hammer horror flicks. \n\n\n\n\nABOUT [u][i]ALABASTER[/i][/u]\n\n[b][u][i]The Doomed Session[/i][/u] is less a pure comedy and more a work of satire[/b]. And its main target isn't bad fan adventures. Its main target is the [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] fandom as a whole. It makes fun of other fandoms as well, and of the general bad sides of any fandom.\nOf course it is full of antics, because for the main tone, I just took Hussie's \"[i]A story almost entirely developed around ridiculous jokes[/i]\" definition and turned it into \"[i]A story almost entirely developed around ridiculous [u]dick[/u] jokes[/i]\". I just sticked the dick in it.\nBut it isn't *structured* as a pure comedy.\n\nIn many ways, [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] is a more classical, reasonable and \"academic\" narration than [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u]. It uses the media, yes, and [url=./Alabaster.html?p=1318]it experiments with it[/url], yes, but differently, soberly. When emulating [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u], I didn't want to have the exact same approach. I wanted to take inspiration, to make a tribute and to study the media and its mechanisms, which is different.\nHussie's story regularly works on the contrast between horrific/dark/nightmarish and funny/light/silly elements. This dissonance constantly gives relief to his narration. You don't find so much of it in my fanwork, where most of the time, the humour is directly born from horror, and sometimes, the horror is left alone without any humour in it.\n\nYou said \"why the gore the gore and stuff just seems too forced and doesnt seem to have a place in parody\". I feel now compelled to answer by a question too: since the 'gore and stuff' are part of the original intent, how is that forced? How does it not have a place in this story? If I wanted to just \"make fun of horrible adventures\", I would leave the job to [u][i]Trol Seasson[/i][/u] or to [url=http://www.mspaforums.com/showthread.php?41866][u][i]Fluidswitched[/i][/u][/url].\n\nThe intended definition of [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] did not change since the beginning, and it isn't \"a parody of horrible adventures\".\n\nIt is intended to be, mainly:\n\n- A satire of fantrolls and fandom,\n- A horror-themed session,\n- A (screwed) pirated version/Perfect Play/Speedrun of SBURB,\n- A panorama of imaginary horror\n- A serious story with developed characters and thematics,\n- An action-packed spectacle,\n- An unofficial [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] spinoff,\n- A fanwork logically extrapolating new elements from canon facts, trying to stay consistent.\n\nEach reader can have their opinion about how successful or unsuccessful I am at realizing any of these objectives. You can say I make a good job at making fun of fantrolls but that the horror aspect is a huge failure since you aren't frightened. You can say the reverse. You can say there are too many errors towards [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] canon, or the action scenes are great. You can say I've been good with every aspect, or bad with all of them. Or that trying to mix these aspects was a bad approach to begin with.\n\nBut the horror aspect has its place here, in any case. It is an important part of the story and of the original intent.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]wow that was a really good response to my question! anyway last question: is the scribbly art style intentional? it SEEMS to be, since you sometimes had very well structured art and sometimes its just WAY all over the place. is there a reason for this?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">First, thank you! :)\n\nNow... Yes, when a panel is scribbly, it's entirely intentional! Just like I am fully able to use Photoshop rather than MS Paint to create pictures with actual details, nuances and clean of any aliasing, and even to realise entire photorealist sceneries, I know how to draw clean pictures.\n\nGenerally, when a panel is scribbly, it's [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]'s Hero Mode.\n\n\nMy take at Hero Mode doesn't work exactly like [url=http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Hero_Mode]Hussie's[/url]. On [url=./Alabaster.html?p=1426]this panel[/url] for example, you can see the head shows more features of the face, it is neither big nor [url=http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100626074908/mspaintadventures/images/thumb/9/90/02096.gif/480px-02096.gif]sphere-shaped[/url], the limbs are \"chubby\" rather than [url=http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100719195541/mspaintadventures/images/thumb/f/f2/02270.gif/480px-02270.gif]elongated[/url] and it really isn't as [url=http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100813071335/mspaintadventures/images/thumb/c/c7/EridanHeromode.PNG/480px-EridanHeromode.PNG]clean[/url] as most Hero Mode panels. \nHussie's way of drawing isn't so ordinary. Everything looks extremely supple and dynamic. I knew I couldn't emulate his Hero Mode by any satisfactory - and more importantly, any quick-to-do - method. So I choose from the start to approach things differently (and once again, more classically).\nThe distinction isn't complete, of course. [url=http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110224075226/mspaintadventures/images/thumb/2/27/03577.gif/640px-03577.gif]Some canon panels[/url] look similar to my take at Hero Mode. You can even find some cute [url=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=006041]chubby arms[/url] if you search long enough.\nI don't know if readers notice a big difference in the approach, but it isn't the point: [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]'s Hero Mode is just about having a quick, efficient and sympathetic way to show the characters and the action outside Hussiesprite Mode. \n\nMy other option for the main representation mode was Vamuin's [url=./Alabaster.html?p=647]Cine Mode[/url], and frankly, I didn't want it to become the default representation of the characters. Cine Mode is not this interesting to draw, for a start: it's mainly serigraphic style with simple zones of violent colors, the least shade and shadow I can do while keeping the panels readable. Additionally, the characters generally have no pupils in this Mode, which is great for giving the trolls really alien and agressive looks, but... well, that's the problem, it gives them really alien and agressive looks. It is a cold vision, it shows them as a predatory and threatening species... Well, they ARE, but the story can't work in my opinion if they all have a D8< face all the time. You have to feel some sympathy for them, you have to feel the way they feel. Another problem with Cine Mode is it's usually harder to convey expressions. Hero Mode is more practical to do this, [url=./Alabaster.html?p=418]you can immediatly tell the way a person feels[/url]. It is more energetic and enjoyable to draw. It also allows me to draw every artist's favorite kind of face: [url=./Alabaster.html?p=657]the completely stupid ones[/url]. \n\nSo I quickly decided to make [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u]'s Hero Mode the main representation mode, mixed with Hussiesprite Mode. It was equally decided early to make the Hero Mode panels scribbly, both to gain time (this adventure is a hobby) and because I like the look of unachieved things. While talking about this, I notice it also works well with the overall thematic of broken/doomed elements in the story... But I didn't make the panels scribbly because of that. I just liked the look of these fuzzy/unfinished panels. It would be easy to clean, but it would take more time, it would satisfy me less and there are other Modes in place to look all clean and bright.\n\nSometimes (rarely), Cine Mode also starts looking as scribbly as Hero Mode, or even scribblier. Generally, it's in order to express strength, speed or emotion better. For example, [url=./assets/img/story/doomed1340.png]when Vamuin tries to free himself from the grasp of a tentacle[/url]. I didn't want to use Hero Mode for this because I wanted him to have adult proportions for the entire scene, but I did want some energetic scribbling. I think expressing the things I want to express through the drawings is more important than to permanently conform to the arbitrary rules I've set for myself in this exercise.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Renart's got crotch height horn sculptures jutting out of the floor. Something like Opechiehemiouedipus's horn car sounds right up his ally.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The horns stuck to the carpet are there BECAUSE they are dangerous. It's one of the many traps of the hive.\n\nRenart doesn't like it very much because he has to clean the carpet later, but he's more reassured with some easy-to-use traps in his respiteblock. If everything else fails, he can retreat to this room and when the enemy follows him there, he pushes or trips them up, right on these things.\n\nThe \"horn car\" constitutes another kind of danger. Mainly for the user.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Dear Alabaster Guy, I, Andrew Hussie, hereby declair that Alabaster: The Doomed Session is blatant copyright infringement, and since I have nothing else to do I order you to cease and desist all Alabaster updates. -Totally Andrew Hussie[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">Oh no!

In human biology, transfusion errors can do nasty things to the body, or even kill it.\n\nFor this reason or another (for example, his panic before the apocalypse), The Secret Leader Of The Main Twelve wasn't in his normal state when he tried to make Renart his slave. Renart is smarter and more prepared than Ophiuchus, so he would probably have killed him anyway, but a kidnapper and enslaver of TROLLS can't survive for a long time without knowing some tricks.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How is the game unwinnable? Last time I was aware, they (presumably) still have a space player who can make Bililous Slick, and it's still TECHNICLY possible to beat the dersite royalty. Mind you, the odds are a gazillion to one, but it's possible.[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The game is (presumably) completely unwinnable because the Players (presumably) fail to win it in the Alpha timeline. Past, present and future coexist in Paradox Space. Any attempt to change the curse of events would result only in secondary, doomed (in the most mundane, [u][i]Homestuck[/i][/u] meaning) timelines.\n\nThat's the most obvious interpretation of \"They were never meant to win\". There may be others. </FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]How come you haven't updated the information on Renart in the OP?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The exposition of the cast isn't the main priority. Extras are just this... Extras. I should update it soon, but for example, right now, I'm more interested in working on the next panels.\nWhile we're at it, from now, the OP is bound to be less updated (or not updated at all) than the Extra Material Pages. So for the cast and such things, you may wish to rather look there. I need to throw a link to the Extra Material in the first message, of course, maybe in my signature too, but once again, that's a thing which can wait a few days.\nBut thank you for reminding me I need to update the information on Renart! That's the kind of thing I tend to forget completely.\n\n\nP.S.: From now on, I'm not going to answer this kind of comment. Readers can keep sending them, they can be very useful since I'm occasionally quite distracted, but I'm not going to react to them other than by correcting the stuff they notice, because on the long term, questions/answers like \"[i]- You forgot to add yellow blood on Renart in this panel - Thank you dude, you're saving my life![/i]\" are neither informative nor funny.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]What shade of green is Sectra on the hemospectrum? Does she have the day vision of a Jadeblood?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The shades of the [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] cast were decided back when everyone thought the hemospectrum was... well, a spectrum. Since, Hussie has officially stated that it is a simple series of twelve shades, plus Karkat's mutant blood.\nI won't retcon their blood for two good reasons:\n- I suppose there still can be some light variation,\n- I already slightly change the shade according to the panel, because of color theory. Precise hue is not that important.\n\nI never intended Sectra to be a jade-blood. She's only close to jade-blood because she is the Space player, and clearly a virgin archetype.\n\nShe is a green-blood. If I was starting the adventure now, I would give her Nepeta's blood color, that's the kind of shade she's meant to have, nothing really noticeable. Sectra has deliberately the most \"unimportant\" blood color.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]Call me paranoid, but I don't think [url=./assets/img/extramaterial/totallyrenart.gif]this guy from Trol Seasson[/url] is Renart. In all seriousness, did the Trol Seasson guy ask before ripping off OtG, or did he just do it randomly?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">They stole my original character. Time to call the lawyers.\n\nMore seriously, like I said before, any [u][i]Alabaster[/i][/u] sprite is free use as long as you credit my work. Something like a mention \"[i]Ophiuchus the Great comes from [u]Alabaster: The Doomed Session[/u][/i]\", somewhere.\n\nBut the [u][i]Trol Seasson[/i][/u] guys have a special license: they don't even need to credit me as long as they continue their work of utter destruction of everything that is good and pure.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n[left][u]If Hussie's Hero Mode isn't so ordinary, how come their heads look like PPGs?[/u][/left]\n[spoiler open=\"Open answer\" close=\"Close answer\"][left]<FONT FACE=\"arial\">The Power-puff Girls?\nTake a closer look at them.\n\n[img]./assets/img/extramaterial/thepowerpuffgirls1.png[/img]\n\nThey have gigantic eyes eating their entire face, the hair is just color and lines put in the circle of the spherical head (complete absence of volume), pink skin and a ragdoll-like body. Seriously, behind the superficial concept, I don't see any real similarity.\n\nIf you're looking for a big visual inspiration, I think you should rather think about [u][i]South Park[/i][/u], at least for \"Hussiesprite\" Mode. The characters have very similar proportions, and more than that, both general designs/art direction are looking for a very flat feeling. Perspective isn't right ([u][i]South Park[/i][/u] doesn't even have any). The limbs move absurdly, and generally in a completely not-supple and not-spectacular fashion.\nAnd about Hero Mode, I think it naturally deviated from Hussiesprite Mode, taking something from both Hussie's usual elongated characters and from the [u][i]Problem Sleuth[/i][/u] stickmen, creating the spider-like creatures we all know and love.\n\nBut anyway, what is your point exactly? This kind of design isn't ordinary, really. It isn't the norm. You can always find exceptions looking like Hussie's work, you can also claim he took some things from Tim Burton (it would be true). But similarities and influences don't mean a work isn't out-of-the-ordinary, it only means... well, influences and similarities.</FONT>[/left][/spoiler]\n\n\n\n</FONT>",
