(Cerulean-Homestuck-Alabaster-Oasis-Snake) is an extended reinterpretation of the Homestuck universe, aiming for maximum consistency and hard science fiction roots. It defines specific postulates for SBURB mechanics, Class and Aspect workings, as well as the history, geography, ecosystems, culture and politics of Alternia and its colony.\nIt is currently represented only in Oasis Nadrama's work [b]Alabaster The Doomed Session[/b] and Cerulean Snake's work [b][url=https://mspfa.com/?s=38151&p=1]The Cerulean Motley Crew[/url][/b].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nArdent thanks to BobisOnlyBob, Flabber Ghast, Le-kanar, Asshat, Shiro, Bloody, Alex, Hayden, Abbey, London, Jacquerel, Pharmacy, Squiggles, and all of the friends of the Forum Adventures community, Homestuck 2.0, MSPFA Discord, Homestuck University and Recuperachat.\nThanks to all of my friends and acquaintances from the Homestuck fan community and from the rest of the world for their help and support.\nThanks to FlaringK for creating the MSPFA Viewer Template, and to Cerulean Snake for putting it to good use in countless hours of work on the Alabaster archive.\nThanks to the MSPFA team, Grant, Nixshadow, Seymour and other for maintaining the main MSPFA website, FileGarden, and generally their constant effort to allow and encourage webcomic and interactive adventure creation. Thanks for all the work put in offering an unique space, unique services and quality archiving.\nThanks to Andrew Hussie and all of the official Homestuck creative teams for their beautiful imaginary world.\n\nAnd thanks to all of my readers. This adventure would have not even existed, and it would not have come back from hiatus, without you, pals. Thank you. Thanks a lot.[/left]\n\n\n\n[i][url=Alabaster.html?p=1]Back to the title screen[/url][/i]\n",

The name of this place is lost to the entire troll civilization since millennia, for this is the strange and deserted legacy of one of many apostate governments this planet knew. The Troll Steward of these days doubted the ancient troll ways, and, like some other twisted and insane planetary intendants before and after her reign, ordered to build myriads of absurd buildings. The Nursery is one of these evidences of past madness.\n\nThis gigantic and tremendous group of buildings, sealed off with spiked gates, crowned with devastating defenses, threaded with many deadly traps in order to protect the brood, and later broken, cracked, eroded, penetrated by the most incongrous and dangerous vegetation, vastly swamped by dark waters and the many fluids and effluvium of long-dead larval pods and wrigglers' recuperacoons, has been the theater of a gargantuan number of historic battles and tragedies. \n\nSo this little wriggler usually stays in his self-chosen respiteblock.\n\nWhat will the name of this little wriggler be?",

While he was resting inside his huge organ palace, he was approached by a tiny creature. Our good leader should have been more cautious, because the [u]Calamari[/u] was the most vicious and maleficent entity. It said it was a seeker of power, and that if it was inserted instead [u]The Kapellmeister[/u]'s body, it could bless our monarch with tireless strength. The price to pay was simple: [u]The Kappelmeister[/u] would look exactly like the [u]Calamari[/u].\nOur leader fell in the trap. He opened his mouth and the [u]Calamari[/u] slipped inside his body. [u]The Kapellmeister[/u] began to grow, to grow, to grow! Soon he was a giant, and he had paws just like the [u]Calamari[/u]'s, incredibly huge and powerful tentacles. The [u]Calamari[/u] grew too, but now, it was inextricably linked to its host. So this monster would never be released into the world. [u]The Kappelmeister[/u] was satisfied and soon returned to his work on the symphonic shield.\nThe trick was simple. While the strength of the body was bottomless, the spirit of [u]The Kappelmeister[/u] wasn't. He needed sleep, and he wasn't getting any. His energetic body never allowed him to sleep. He began to moan and to scream, but the [u]Calamari[/u] said the pact could not be abrogated.\nWith time, [u]The Kappelmeister[/u]'s soul became weak, partially amnesiac and irritated. He was now more malleable than modelling clay. The [u]Calamari[/u] assumed leadership.

Actually, this is not your name, but you were bored to death with the naming conventions of this background, and you always hated TYANHA POLNIU anyway. A female character name stereotypically ending with a \"a\" would be bad enough already, but you were also unlucky enough to inherit a catgirl-like \"niuh\". You platonically hate your appellation.\n\nLike most terrible settings, Alternia's character creation is confusing the race and the job - here, more the BLOOD and the CLASS. Apparently, you are supposed to be a NOBLE because you were born inside the blue caste. Well, fuck this pre-rolled shit, the same random rules which deprived you of real musculature, stylish lusus and psionic powers. And which gave you four quadrants to fill before the arbitrary threshold of adulthood. You platonically hate this world with a passion...\n\nYou have a variety of INTERESTS. But you won't talk about them now because this is the worst way of introducing a character. If someone wants to truly know you, they just have to look at the sheets. All thirty of them. And your detailed chronicles for your character's action. They could also look at other characters of you, come on, CROSSOVER has to be amongst the less interesting ones.\n\nYou have ONE MAIN INTEREST anyway, and everything else is revolving around it, and it's TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING. Those are golden letters above a large door to you, and the door leads to NARRATION, HEROISM, FASCINATING INQUIRIES, POWERFUL TRAGEDIES and LEGENDARY EPICS. \nAt least when the LORE is coherent. ALTERNIA isn't, it is developed entirely around ridiculous jokes and makes no sense whatsoever, so you prefer to spend your time submerged in much better games such as CAHOWA, SENZAR, FROM ANOTHER TIME; ANOTHER LAND, ADVANCED DUMBASSES & DIMWITS, SYNNIBAR, HYBRID, RAINBOW DRINKER: THE MOCKERY, or MUSCLEBEAST: THE CATASTROPHE.\n\nYou take pride in your energetic, penetrating and meticulous mind. Since Alternia is your main CROSSROAD-world, with a MYST-like book interface to other universes, you have to preserve your avatar as well as you can - with time, you came to know a lot about its STUPID LORE. It's a huge part of your tomes, and this gratuitous apocalypse thing, impossibly linked to some elusive cosmic game, is your last trial to allow this particular incarnation to munchkin its way to godhood. You are applying all of your cerebral resources to this session. You are going to show everyone how this game is played.\n\nYour trolltag is [color=#08088A]criticalOutlander[/color] and [color=#08088A]✝o s✝ay e✘act, you do✝ your i's and cross your ✝'s![/color]\n",
