You are the hype thing, you are the sports thing, you are the sexy thing.\n\nYour name is VAMUIN IKENGA.\n\nYou have a large variety of INTERESTS, all of them being the most POPULAR AND STYLISH THINGS EVER. You are mainly an AWESOME SURFER, but you're also good at ALTERNIAN FOOTBALL, WILD SKATEBOARDING, BASKETBALL, BASEBALL, and MUSCLEBEAST DECAPITATEBALL. You organize CRAZY PARTIES where you invite everyone you know and don't know, and also MORE TIGHT PARTIES with only the most popular and beautiful young persons.\n\nYour muscular, tall and handsome body, DEEPLY TANNED by moonburn naps every night and ultraviolet sessions every day, displays PIERCINGS, but NOT TOO MANY OF THEM, because the last thing you desire is to not be wanted or accepted everywhere, by everyone. That is also why you know ALTERNATIVE MUSIC, but don't listen to it frequently, and that's the very reason you don't allow yourself to PAINT or to SING or to PLAY VIDEOGAMES everyday. ",

You tried all kind of jobs and you like to think and claim you were always astounding at it. You trained well in order to join the ALTERNIAN ARMY someday, like all adults in your species. You seduced myriads of magnificent trolls. \n\nYou are a HIGH LEVEL PSIONIC. You are as strong as one can get without being a freak. You have the most stylish lusus. You have A LOT OF FRIENDS, because being ill with friendship is quite the hype thing these days. And of course, ALL OF YOUR ROMANCE QUADRANTS ARE FILLED. You are NOT PARTICULARLY LOYAL to them, however, because you're just too cool to be the man of only four trolls.\n\nYou are also NINE SWEEPS OLD, the troll equivalent to NINETEEN HUMAN YEARS, because there is no way the most awesome of awesome awesomies can't do the bucket thing. No. Way. In. Hell. And ALL OF THE PEOPLE YOU WILL EVER MEET will be nine sweeps old too.\n\nFurthermore, you are THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE BLOOD WITHOUT BEING SOME KIND OF FISHY FREAK. Aquatic fauna just isn't sexy enough.\n\nYou have just installed a new pirated game, but you have not launched it yet. Your trolltag is [color=#045FB4]righteousPornstar[/color] and [color=#045FB4]yo°u like to° indicate yo°ur magnificent nipple piercing because, co°me o°n, it's just that aweso°me![/color]",

The Nursery is one of these evidences of past madness.\n\nThis gigantic and tremendous group of buildings, sealed off with spiked gates, crowned with devastating defenses, threaded with many deadly traps in order to protect the brood, and later broken, cracked, eroded, penetrated by the most incongrous and dangerous vegetation, vastly swamped by dark waters and the many fluids and effluvium of long-dead larval pods and wrigglers' recuperacoons, has been the theater of a gargantuan number of historic battles and tragedies. \n\nSo this little wriggler usually stays in his self-chosen respiteblock.\n\nWhat will the name of this little wriggler be?",

In fact, there's not much except for some thin fissures filling the room with WHITE MIST.\n\nThere is a variety of vapors permeating the whole Orpiment Boron Sensitive Complex of Extraction, Nursery and Education, since there is not only RECUPERACOONS down there, but also LARVAL PODS and VARIOUS MEDS, all of this slowly putrefying since millenia. Sopor-filled cocoons are especially slow to decompose, because they are biotechnological products conceived for permanence. In addition, slime itself possesses conservative qualities not unlike those of formaldehyde.\n\nConsequently, vapors come in every flavour, and some of them are even invisible. WHITE MIST is especially soft and sugary.\n\nThe next PHIXED RIDDLE is:\n\n[i]I have my twin in the dark sky, but he's girly, I don't like him, he has a child but so tiny.

He had to lighten it up a few minutes before you reach the room. He is clearly moving, using his science of these ancient doors in order to follow you without being caught. You wonder if it means he'll be CHASING you? Hide-and-seek is so fun!\n\nHe should stop with explosives, though. These old ruins are so fragile. You preferred when he was using a lot of kitchen tools.\n\nThere is nothing interesting in this room besides an ENORMOUS HIGH-POWERED FLASHLIGHT. Like most trolls, you have fairly good nocturne vision, plus it's waaaay too heavy for Baby's First Modus. Too bad, because it's pretty!\n\nYou immediatly use the fan and reach the next room.",

[u]The Kapellmeister[/u] began to grow, to grow, to grow! Soon he was a giant, and he had paws just like the [u]Calamari[/u]'s, incredibly huge and powerful tentacles. The [u]Calamari[/u] grew too, but now, it was inextricably linked to its host. So this monster would never be released into the world. [u]The Kappelmeister[/u] was satisfied and soon returned to his work on the symphonic shield.\nThe trick was simple. While the strength of the body was bottomless, the spirit of [u]The Kappelmeister[/u] wasn't. He needed sleep, and he wasn't getting any. His energetic body never allowed him to sleep. He began to moan and to scream, but the [u]Calamari[/u] said the pact could not be abrogated.\nWith time, [u]The Kappelmeister[/u]'s soul became weak, partially amnesiac and irritated.

I decided it by myself and for myself. Because you can choose to be happy or sad and whichever you choose that is what you get. No one is really responsible to make someone else happy, no matter what most people have been taught and accept as true.[/i]\"\n\n\n[spoiler open=\"Open AIM-log\" close=\"Close AIM-log\"][left][color=#3A01DF]RR: i mean, just look at the last Troll Sea|son epi|sode, the monologue of the Ugliest Lusus, it's so tou|ching...[/color]\n[color=#868A08]DD: Oh [Are] yes, [you] my [kidding] dialogue [me?] is [This] so [show] smart [is] because [so] I'm [absurd] using [I] three-syllable [can't] words!

You have items to move from a Time Capsule to another, in a precise order, too. \n\nYou're using the calculator of your polycrownatic to do the maths, but it's taking a lot of time.

Actually, this is not your name, but you were bored to death with the naming conventions of this background, and you always hated TYANHA POLNIU anyway. A female character name stereotypically ending with a \"a\" would be bad enough already, but you were also unlucky enough to inherit a catgirl-like \"niuh\". You platonically hate your appellation.\n\nLike most terrible settings, Alternia's character creation is confusing the race and the job - here, more the BLOOD and the CLASS. Apparently, you are supposed to be a NOBLE because you were born inside the blue caste. Well, fuck this pre-rolled shit, the same random rules which deprived you of real musculature, stylish lusus and psionic powers. And which gave you four quadrants to fill before the arbitrary threshold of adulthood. You platonically hate this world with a passion...\n\nYou have a variety of INTERESTS. But you won't talk about them now because this is the worst way of introducing a character. If someone wants to truly know you, they just have to look at the sheets. All thirty of them. And your detailed chronicles for your character's action. They could also look at other characters of you, come on, CROSSOVER has to be amongst the less interesting ones.\n\nYou have ONE MAIN INTEREST anyway, and everything else is revolving around it, and it's TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING. Those are golden letters above a large door to you, and the door leads to NARRATION, HEROISM, FASCINATING INQUIRIES, POWERFUL TRAGEDIES and LEGENDARY EPICS. \nAt least when the LORE is coherent. ALTERNIA isn't, it is developed entirely around ridiculous jokes and makes no sense whatsoever, so you prefer to spend your time submerged in much better games such as CAHOWA, SENZAR, FROM ANOTHER TIME; ANOTHER LAND, ADVANCED DUMBASSES & DIMWITS, SYNNIBAR, HYBRID, RAINBOW DRINKER: THE MOCKERY, or MUSCLEBEAST: THE CATASTROPHE.\n\nYou take pride in your energetic, penetrating and meticulous mind. Since Alternia is your main CROSSROAD-world, with a MYST-like book interface to other universes, you have to preserve your avatar as well as you can - with time, you came to know a lot about its STUPID LORE. It's a huge part of your tomes, and this gratuitous apocalypse thing, impossibly linked to some elusive cosmic game, is your last trial to allow this particular incarnation to munchkin its way to godhood. You are applying all of your cerebral resources to this session. You are going to show everyone how this game is played.\n\nYour trolltag is [color=#08088A]criticalOutlander[/color] and [color=#08088A]✝o s✝ay e✘act, you do✝ your i's and cross your ✝'s![/color]\n",
