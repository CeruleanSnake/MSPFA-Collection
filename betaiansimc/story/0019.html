				Your desktop is littered with a variety of folders and icons.<br><br>
				Most of these pictures are from your rather poor art attemps. You love drawing but god you suck at it so much.<br><br>
				Among those are two of your most used programs, your game library launcher and Tumult. You mostly use Tumult for roleplay as your OC, but you occasionally use it to keep in touch with friends.<br> Back on the homeworld, it was a tradition to talk with a quirk. Here, however, that tradition eventually died off over hundreds of sweeps. <br>Most of the younger trolls thought it was stupid.<br><br>
				You still use quirks, but only for your roleplays. How else are you going to show your cool OC has such a cute lisp just like you???<br><br>
				Speaking of which, someone sent you a message on Tumult just now!
