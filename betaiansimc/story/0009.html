				Your name is Chiavi Stalii.<br><br>
				
				You currently live on the outskirts of the highblood district in M'yutun City, a small colony planet that is covered in a suburban jungle.
				<br><br>
				You have a variety of incredibly nerdy interests.<br>
				You like to dabble in advanced synthetic tech along with a litle bit of nuclear physics. You're not the best but you'll get better, by god! At least hopefully your projects will stop blowing up!<br>
				You also enjoy researching genetics. Always fascinating to know where you came from and where you're going to go, plus it makes you look smarter.<br><br>
				Aside from your research and projects, you also enjoy gaming from time to time. You have a variety of games you're always pirating to keep the boredom at bay.<br>
				You also like to partake in roleplaying with your peers, particually in the popular fantasy tabletop everyones raving about. You spend days writing up fanfics of your own characters and the antics they get up to. You have a rappidly growing fanbase that watch your work.<br><br>
				
				Unfortunately, you were hatched with a hearing impairment. To substitute, you fashioned yourself a pair of hearing aids that look just like robo antennas because that's just fucking awesome.<br>
				Like most trolls on the planet, you prefer not to share your shortcomings. Being a mutant in the city has been known to meet misfortunes.<br><br>
				
				Today has been a rather slow day, but you have a feeling that will quickly change.<br><br>
				
				What will you do?
