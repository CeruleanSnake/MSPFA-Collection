				It's your Cavernous Systems & Dragonite Lusii OC and he is soooo awesome!<br><br>
				
				You based him off your Ancestor, The Cerulean Snake, who was a master space pirate thousands of sweeps ago. Your genetic research managed to uncover your link and you found all sorts of neat, hidden info during your data sweeping in lost archives.<br>
				That's how you also got the blueprints for these sweet antennas.<br><br>

				<i>A daring space thief, willing to stand up against<br>
				tyrany and liberate those who have been wronged<br>

				Regarded as a troll Robbin Hood amongst the<br>
				stars, he helps the lower class and robs the higher.<br>
				He is also the perfect ladies man too!</i><br><br>
