Unfortunately, most of the team lost interest and this fanventure eventually died. It's suffered from digital rot and to this day I have not been able to recover the final images.\n\n~ CeruleanSnake\n====================================",

You are also a bit of a fanatic about BLADES AND KNVES. You love a good strong quality knife and carry your trusty SWITCH BLADE with you always. and your knife has gotten you out of quite a few jams, and in to quite a few too. \nWhen not watching movies, you tend to enjoy a bit of gaming. Thats right you are a BIG NERD at heart as you are often secretly found playing pokemon and a few other childish games. You are particually fond of BUG POKEMON mostly as you own a neat collection of dead bugs, and you have a killer PET SPIDER named charorlette. You also love jamming on your ELECTRIC BASS, you pour your passion and soul into your music, but its probably best you don't play publicly, you material would need heavy censoring. \nSometimes you also like to get a bit drunk.\n\nIts quite a hot, summer morning, pretty normal for the month of FEBRUARY in the land down under, you have your fan set to ludicrous speed.\n\nWhat will you do?",
