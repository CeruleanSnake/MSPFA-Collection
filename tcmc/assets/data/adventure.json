			"comm": "Welcome to The Cerulean Motley Crew!\n\nThis will have to be my biggest project I have ever taken up on. Would you also believe this was my first ever time with major coding too? It's been a great experiment and project and I have learnt so many skills, even despite my reboot from the [url=../betatcmc/index.html]original version[/url].\nI honestly don't regret rebooting, I have a much better story structure, more fleshed out characters and the original served as a good training ground to get my style down.\nThis project has also given me something creative to work on. Being physically disabled it can be tough to actually get out and keep your mind active, so I guess you could say its kinda like my therapy, lol!\n\nThe original story was a concept I actually thought up many many years ago, probably 2012 or so. I never really did anything with it though. The first time I really started a MSPA-styled was with 3 other friends on [url=https://mspfa.com/?s=6779&p=1]Go Stuck Yourself[/url] in 2014 (I drew the Chaz Parts).\nLike many team projects, interest died and it fell to the wayside. I never really did try again after that.\n\nSo how did I get started on this?\nYears later, In 2020, I managed to catch up with a few old friends in the Homestuck scene. So I was chatting away with [url=https://mspfa.com/user/?u=111108168127693948558]peepee swine[/url] and she was talking about how she throws in a bunch of trolls in the background of [url=https://mspfa.com/?s=21746&p=1]I'm Good, I'm Gone[/url]. I said \"Damn I wish my troll was in a fanventure or some sort\" and she said \"Why not make one?\" So I said \"You know what, yeah! why not?\"\nSo I sat down, dusted off my old pirate concept, polished it a bit and got to work. Within 20 or so days I had drawn up 30 panels and finally started publishing on MSPFA. Of course I got sick, saw lots of doctors and it fell to the backburner a bit.\n\nIt gave me some time to look over the story, realise what I wanted and where I was struggling and decided to reboot the comic a year later, so here we are today! Never been more prouder in any of my projects!\n\nThis commentary snippet has gone on way too long now, I promise the others wont be so long lol... maybe...\nAnyway, enjoy reading! I've enjoyed drawing it!\n\n-TheCeruleanSnake",

			"comm": "Animating the glasses panel was probably my fav. It was actually pretty easy, just slap on a few effects and bam!\nI also needed to establish Chever's cool eye patch instead of just pulling it out of nowhere.\n\nThis is probably the first personal interaction between Chever and Jujuju. With Jujuju, I stuck with a theme of 3 as a piss take on Sollux's duality theme, plus also it matches her symbol and is an important reoccurring number throughout the comic.\nEspecially considering the comic started on the 3rd of November (2nd US time but that doesn't count). This page was also published on the 3rd of January (magic innit?).\n\nIt's also the first time a trans character is revealed. There's 3 in total (LOOK 3 AGAIN!!!) but we find out later. I really wanted a positive story surrounding trans characters who are actually happy as opposed to the multitude of miserable trans stories on the internet.\nAs a trans person myself, I personally find that to be really disappointing... so here we go! Zany adventures with trans characters!!\n\n-TheCeruleanSnake",

Don't let anyone tell you its bad to be proud of your work, because it's good when you put your blood, sweat and tears (ok well not physically in this case) into something.\n\nI actually worked on this for 3 weeks, most of the time was spent drawing up the assets, making sure things animate correctly and waiting for my brother to code up the engine.\nUnfortunately, my bro pulled out 3 days before publishing which threw me into a tough spot.\n\nI spent 2 days trying to fuck around in unity and realised it would take me FOREVER, then I had an idea. I could break up my game into segments and animate it all through Google Web Designer, which is probably the most unconventional way to make a game, lol.\n\nSo I went ass down and put it all together in a mere 24 hours, I was so exhausted by the end but I was happy with the result.\n\nThere's bugs here and there, I tried to fix as many as I could, but one day i might return and make this a little more compatible. maybe add a flashless version too. I guess you could say so far this is my Magnum Opus in the comic.\n\n-TheCeruleanSnake",

However, she spoke with more of a scottish accent. I decided to switch it up to something more spanish considering every troll and their lusus speaks in some form of scottish style in the comic, considering the pirate shit and all.\n\nHer name (aside from Freya) is also a mix of Spanish words (and one fudged word to fit the F theme) relating to fire. It's also comically long strictly for the funniez, not because of anything else, really.\n\nWhy did I pick Spanish? If you remember from one of my earlier quips, it's one of the 3 settings that always shows up in pirate stories, plus has some really fun architecture to draw.\n\nI'm not a native speaker, so I've got some help on the side to make sure things sound at least decent (thanks [url=https://mspfa.com/user/?u=114398804650688280359]Fruz[/url]!)\n\nAlso, god damn I hated drawing that dress, so much lines.\n\n-TheCeruleanSnake",

What gives??\n\nWell, this was a tough thing actually.\nNaturally, horns on animals do have a bone anchor and blood at the base while the actual horn is grown and extended from it.

It shows the horns aren't even attached to any bone at all, just little pockets where they would be on the skull (Maybe biology wasn't Hussie's strong point).\n\n[img]./assets/img/extra/Troll_skeleton.webp[/img]\n\nSo, I decided to take a little artistic liberty and not draw any blood (I mean, Chever has a lot of hair, maybe it's hidden).\n\nWho knows, maybe only the very base is supplied with blood and troll horns just break off easy as a survival mechanic? Maybe they do grow back?\n\nWe got a large blank canvas here, but to be fair we barely get any details on troll anatomy aside from funny names, seadwellers breathe underwater and they're capable of pissing out ludicrous amounts of blood that would even turn a vampire off.\n\n\nAs to why Chever lost their horns? I got sick of drawing them, I would be drawing them a LOT and they're not exactly easy to draw.\n\n-TheCeruleanSnake",
