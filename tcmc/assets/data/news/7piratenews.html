    =======================

    Medical issues always makes things difficult. I'm going to continue updating as best I can though while I deal with sleep apnea.

    I'm also working on my top surgery! I have surgeon appointments booked however in 6+ month (I hope) my activity might drop considerably due to the surgery. It will be the final step in my transitioning after 11 years!

    At least for the meantime during my short hiatus, Oasis' Alabaster updates with our crossover have been keeping you company! I will be starting the first major half of my side of the crossover in chapter 4.
