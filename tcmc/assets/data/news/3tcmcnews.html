    =======================

    I am well aware that there seems to be a particular issue regarding the the rainy theme causing flickering on monitors larger than 1920x1080 resolution. I have tried applying some fixes but I am not sure if it's working. 

    If you do experience page flickering, I found refreshing the page tends to temporarily fix it. If not, try turning off the background animation as that will surely fix it. 

    This does not affect devices with smaller screens such as phones and tablets due to specific settings I have implemented.

    <span class="redtext">IF YOU EXPERIENCE EPILEPSY, PLEASE READ THIS IN A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM AND ON A SCREEN 1920x1080 OR SMALLER.</span> 

    I apologise for any problems this may have caused.
