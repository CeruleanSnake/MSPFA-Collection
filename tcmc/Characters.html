                                        With skills in biotech and cybersecurity plus their experience in Alternian
                                        military and sea
                                        warfare, Chever fit the bill as self declared ship
                                        captain.<br><br>
                                        Despite lacking raw strength and hatched deaf, their resourcefulness in

                                        their shortcomings makes up for it. This allows them to be a rather flexible

                                        Chever can be often plagued by irrationality and child-like whimsy, making

                                        After losing his lusus and taken under the wing of the rather cruel Director
                                        while
                                        he was 4, Derrek
                                        was put through torturous training to become a deadly swordsman. With a laser
                                        focus,
                                        Derrek will focus on his task and get it done, no matter what.<br><br>
                                        With his psiionics, he can manipulate peoples souls and gain essences of their
                                        life.
                                        However this will only work on those dead or dying. Consuming them will merge
                                        the
                                        soul
                                        with his own.<br><br>
                                        Derrek is not without emotion though, should something conflict with his morals,
                                        he
                                        will often hesitate. He has a tendency to second guess himself due to sweeps of
                                        mistreatment, giving him a rather low self confidence and esteem.

                                        Energetic and sunny, Jujuju likes to get shit done as long as its on her terms.

                                        Jujuju's boldness does come with its downsides. She will often act without

                                        and come off direct and rude. A side effect from her past as a slave before

                                        As an expert in physical security systems, Diunna makes for a great locksmith
                                        and

                                        Freya is an adept steam engineer and a secret lover of art. As her culture puts
                                        great emphasis on physical engineering, she rarely has an opportunity to let her
                                        creativity flourish.<br><br>
                                        Despite misconceptions, Freya is no more hotheaded than the next person and
                                        often
                                        quite grounded. She is
                                        fiercely protective of those she hold dear and will go to great lengths
                                        protecting
                                        them, even sacrificing herself, making her a loyal asset.<br><br>
                                        Prideful and a little bit self centered, she often hides her insecurities and
                                        can
                                        come off arrogant. Part of which caused an assassination on her life. After
                                        being
                                        saved by Govani, she vowed to follow him to the ends of the planet.

                                        never stopped that from doing what he loved - making clothes for people.<br><br>

                                        <b>Race:</b> Violet Alternian<br><br>
                                        Viktor can be described as a gambling man, notorious slaver and fancier of fine
                                        ruffled shirts. His love for piracy is only rivaled by his love of strong
                                        booze.<br><br>
                                        Larger than life, Viktor enjoys coming up with a good and particularly dirty
                                        insult.
                                        He would rather talk (or offend) his way out of a hairy situation but does not
                                        mid a
                                        good fight.<br><br>
                                        Viktor and Edmond crossed paths in their early days on the seas. After a
                                        particularly bad
                                        mishap, Viktor was spared from a violent end through a slave riot by Edmond,
                                        which
                                        took his leg. He had
                                        owed him a life debt since. While the two are at odds, Edmond saw Viktor's
                                        skills in
                                        trafficking valuable for his later operations.
