# CeruleanSnakes MSPFA Collection Archive
This is a consolidated collective of mine and others works (with permission) on the [MSPFA website](https://mspfa.com/) for achival and examples. It's also my workspace for creating my pages. Most likely still WIP.

This was thrown together using FlaringK's [MSPFA Viewer](https://github.com/FlaringK/mspfaViewer) and many scripts from MSPFA.
