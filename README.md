# CeruleanSnakes MSPFA Collection Archive
This is a consolidated collective of mine and others works (with permission) on the [MSPFA website](https://mspfa.com/) for achival and examples. It's also my workspace for creating my pages. Most likely still WIP.

This was thrown together using FlaringK's [MSPFA Viewer](https://github.com/FlaringK/mspfaViewer) and many scripts from MSPFA.

## Viewing The Archive
To view the archive you'll need to Run the archive in a server setup due to browser limitations surrounding .json files. First, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and enter this in your windows command prompt (I don't use Linux and don't know the Linux equivalent) to install the http server module needed for the local server.
```
npm install -g http-server
```

Once install, Just run the .bat file named "MSPFA Portal" and it will auto launch a local server and open up a browser window.
