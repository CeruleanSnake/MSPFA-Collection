Not to mention getting rich while doing it too!<br /><br />It was just your luck you managed to pick up details of one of the Empress' personal ships. Turns out it's on a private mission to deliver some of her most prized possessions while she is out on galactic conquest. Stealing this should really throw a spanner in the Fish Witch's works while also landing you on a number of serious shit lists.<br /><br />Clearly, it's important enough to be powered by its own goldblood. Most low grade ships have to be flown manually as those with the strongest psiionics are reserved for the big warships. You couldn't possibly begin to imagine what sort of riches and supplies could be on the ship.<br />Whatever is on there, it will fund your Gamblignant operation for sweeps!<br /><br />No Seagrift worth their salt would pass up this glorious opportunity... except maybe those who realise this would be the most riskiest plunder of all.",
