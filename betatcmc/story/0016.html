                You and your crew wander further into the ship, looking out for any riches.<br><br>

                The deeper you go, the more you begin to realise GG was onto something. <br>
                The ship does not feel quite right and you begin to develop a growing sense of dread with each step.
                You notice there is an eerie lack of armed forces about the place and most of the sleeping crew
                consist of higherbloods. <br>
                On top of all that, you have not found anything remotly lavish that is fit for a royal. This is
                looking less and less like a cargo ship.<br><br>

                Could your sources be wrong? You are sure Rat double checked the leak she picked up... But... if
                they really are, you will become a laughing stock rather than a legend as you hoped.<br><br>

                Eventually, you and your crew come across a rather lavish door that is heavily reinforced. Just the
                sight of it begins to stir up emotions you have not felt for a long time. You get the feeling you
                know exactly what ship this is...<br><br>
