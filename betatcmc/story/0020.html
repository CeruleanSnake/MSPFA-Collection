                You feel like you could physically kick yourself.<br><br>

                As soon as you heard that snarky voice, it all became very clear. The ship must have undergone some
                remodeling since, but you remember it well.<br>
                This was the ship you spent half a sweep in. Particularly in the holding cells.<br><br>

                You could almost feel his smirk from behind. How could you let yourself become entangled in his net
                again? This time you plan on on slipping through his fingers but you decide to toy with him a little
                to nurse your bruised ego first.
