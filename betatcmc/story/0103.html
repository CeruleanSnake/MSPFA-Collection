                You decide to quietly explain to Jujuju who this strange pirate is while he takes his time
                wracking his thinkpan for your name. <br>He also throws in a couple mumbles about the lack of
                actual highbloods and riches.<br><br> You know him as Protus "Ebony" Polybo, captain of the Ebony
                Pirates and a notorious
                scourge of space.<br><br>
                He's known through the Empire from his numerous crimes both large and small, and arguably has earned his
                smug exterior. He commands hundreds on his ship and uses those numbers to overwhelm any
                opposition.<br><br>You've come across him a few times long before you became a pirate and only once
                after. The fact that he has you practically in his brig with your pants down is just utterly
                humiliating!<br><br> No doubt word of your downfall will spread through the underbelly in short time.
