                You spin around to see a few trolls enter the mess hall. <br>They're a little early for
                lunch...<br><br>You know the one who spoke as Satsue "Metal Wielder" Neodym.<br>He is
                leader of the
                Bronze Division in the Ebony Crew.<br>Despite his small stature, which you kinda relate to, he's more
                dangerous than he seems. He
                isn't all too great physically, but he can use his magnetic power to affect metal to extreme degrees,
                making him quite the asset.
                <br><br>The Indigo standing behind him is Chabyr "Steel
                Fists"
                Scylah and Vice Captain of the Ebony Pirates.<br> First and most loyal member of the crew, having
                known Protus
                almost her entire life, almost like you and Jujuju in a way. She only wields gauntlets as her prized
                arms and even
                by Indigo standards possesses great physical
                strength.<br>Jujuju had a few run-ins with her before, so you'll have to stay on your toes.<br><br>You
                have
                no fucking clue who the clown is though but damn, her nail game puts yours to shame.
                Must be a new recruit to the crew.
