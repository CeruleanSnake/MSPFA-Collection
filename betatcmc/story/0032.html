                You wake up locked in a deserted <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/jailbreak/1" target="_blank">jail
                    cell</a>,
                completely alone. There is nothing at all in your cell, useful or otherwise.<br><br>

                You're starting to get sick of this scenery as you near your third perigee since that fateful night
                one of your trusted crew sold you out.<br>
                Since your confinement, you have been stripped of practically any personal possession, even your cool
                tech eye and hearing antennas. Thankfully you still have the base as you would be practically deaf
                without it, the antennas were just for show. At least the seabastard had the decency to give you an
                eye patch.<br>
                Who knows what horror lurks beneath.<br><br>

                Now, you are currently a part of an eccentric, royal bounty hunter's collection. He has stripped you
                of your sign, as customary with crimes of your nature, and replaced with his own to really rub it in
                that he owns your ass.<br>
                You wake up every night with only one goal in mind; to escape.<br><br>

                What will you do?
