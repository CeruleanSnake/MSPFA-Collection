                You both wander aimlessly through the derelict town.<br><br>
                Despite it being only a few sweeps, the town has changed drastically since you were last stationed
                here.. Somehow it seems even more run down than before.
                You barely recognize any place of interest.<br><br>After passing the same bum
                for
                the third time, you decide to consult your
                nifty crew file.<br><br>As luck would have it, there seems to be a quick write up from The Director
                himself
                about
                this place. Looks like the fish was thinking of dipping his feet in the planetary real estate
                market.<br><br>

                                M'yutuna was the first planet conquered by our mighty empire. It has the perfect
                                atmosphere
                                to turn into a thriving colony.<br><br>
                                Was home to a strange race of beings made of fire? Almost all are killed off,
                                experimented
                                on or in slavery. They put up very little fight, rather peaceful. Exploitable, I
                                say.<br><br>
                                Home to the Alternian Galactic Gold Mine which doubles as a maximum security prison.
                                Perfect
                                place to send that oliveblood muscle.

                                Small towns dotted all over. Plenty of those native beast's ruins too. Most notable seem
                                to
                                be
                                Medusaa. Converted capital city, mostly destroyed. Filled with unsociable filth. Seems
                                to
                                be
                                a place to dump injured lowbloods. They seem fond of the local watering
                                hole.<br><br>Should
                                see about acquiring ownership of the
                                planet. A bit of house cleaning and it will be a good place for my experiments.
