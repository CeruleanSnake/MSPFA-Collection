                It's a picture you took of GG when you first met.<br><br>

                She is the whole reason you became a pirate in the first place as well as the very first member of your
                crew.<br>
                Since then, you have never been apart... aside from the times you were in this cell.<br><br>

                She has no idea you still have this picture.<br>
                Perhaps its time you come clean to her, you never know when you'll never get another chance.<br><br>

                You need to find her first!
