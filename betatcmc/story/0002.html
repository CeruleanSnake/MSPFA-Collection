        This is the moment your crew has been building up for!<br /><br />

        Ever since you became fed up with the way the Empress ran things and
        deserted the military, you have been planning on ways to get under
        her skin and disrupt her operations... Not to mention getting rich
        while doing it too!<br /><br />

        It was just your luck you managed to pick up details of one of the
        Empress' personal ships. Turns out it's on a private mission to
        deliver some of her most prized possessions while she is out on
        galactic conquest. Stealing this should really throw a spanner in
        the Fish Witch's works while also landing you on a number of serious
        shit lists.<br /><br />

        Clearly, it's important enough to be powered by its own goldblood.
        Most low grade ships have to be flown manually as those with the
        strongest psiionics are reserved for the big warships. You couldn't
        possibly begin to imagine what sort of riches and supplies could be
        on the ship.<br />
        Whatever is on there, it will fund your Gamblignant operation for
        sweeps!<br /><br />

        No Seagrift worth their salt would pass up this glorious
        opportunity... except maybe those who realise this would be the most
        riskiest plunder of all.
