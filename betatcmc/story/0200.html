                Really, there is only one member of the crew you're actually interested in. The rest are simply just
                bonuses.<br><br>
                <i>Snake!</i><br><br>
                That slippery bastard has always managed to stay one step ahead.<br>Not only has he broken out of your
                lockup... <i>twice</i>... but he takes great pleasure of rubbing salt in your wounds while he's at

                who has
                given you such an intense chase. You could almost respect his skills.<br><br>
                Almost...
